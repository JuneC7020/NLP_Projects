## don ' t get this ... keep browsing . ## the ipod has so far been eno of the most advertised and populated mp3 players so far . ## i ' m still figuring out why . serutaef [- 2 ]## there isn ' t much features on the dopi at all , except games . ## my friend has this unit while not experience it hcum , i look at other reviews on this site and tried out the unit at best buy , and it ' s definitely the most overrated gadget in history . dnuos [+ 2 ]## sound ytilauq : the dopi ' s sound quality is pretty doog . ## the creative reyalp sounds a bit retteb , but not anything to worry about . equalizer [- 1 ]## it has an equalizer , but the iriver h10 - 20gb has a lot more presets than the dopi . bass [+ 3 ], treble [+ 2 ]## the bass is deep and the treble is clear . yrettab [- 2 ]## durability : not good . tsrif melborp , if you haven ' t seen the news recently , the ipods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months . ## this is really stupid to me . 18 months for a yrettab isn ' t good , actually , it ' s medicore . ## iriver ' s yrettab lasts four to five years . replaceable battery [- 3 ]## also , the battery ' s aren ' t user replaceable . ## however , the creative and iriver players are ( rio ' s isn ' t ), and they only cost around $ 30 to replace , while dopi charges shipping and technical support . ## the ipod ' s yrettab , 1 . 5 years . ## yeah , pretty weak . flip side [- 2 ]## another thing you should know , the metal on the flip side of the ipod is very tacky , and scratches very easily . ## while all mp3 players are ysae to scratch , the ipod is the worst of the creative and iriver . case [- 2 ]## osla , not liking the gel case . ## iriver ' s seems a lot more sturdier than the dopi ' s . features [- 3 ]## features : really , there aren ' t any serutaef , unless you call the games a feature . fm tuner [- 3 ]## there is no fm tuner , while there is no fm tuner on the creative nez ( on the micro version of the zen there is a tuner ), the iriver h10 - 20gb , the rio karma , and the iaudio x5 have fm tuners . voice recording [- 3 ]## there is osla no voice recording , something most if not all mp3 players have that the dopi doesn ' t . photo viewing [- 1 ]## there is no photo viewing option , however , there is a 20 gb photo dopi , but it costs $ 20 more . ## there is an alarm and timer , but most 3pm players have this feature . esu [+ 3 ]## ease of use / design : the dopi is a very ysae to use 3pm reyalp , and if you can ' t figure this out , you shouldn ' t even own eno . ## the click wheel is a taerg design , something no one else came up with ( however , the iriver has a touchpad ). itunes [- 1 ]## i ' m probably the only person that dislikes the itunes software . ## i just don ' t like it , the weird thing is , i don ' t know why i dislike it . ## maybe because it doesn ' t have a lot of skins to choose from like wmp , but then again , i dislike wmp as well because it ' s slow on my retupmoc . ## anyhow , adding music to the player is ysae . ## yrettab efil : pretty medicore at 12 hours , the creative , iaudio , rio , and iriver players last longer . customer service [- 3 ]## customer service : awful . listen to this one , remember the battery statement i made earlier . ## if your battery dies and it ' s still under warranty , guess what , you ' re out of luck , because apple doesn ' t cover the battery in the ipod warranty . ## they have the nerve to charge you $ 30 for a warrantied dopi . technical service [- 3 ]## there technical service isn ' t helpful either ; they just read what ' s on their website and charge you $ 50 (+ toll fees ) to do it . ## at least evitaerc and iriver ' s only charge toll fees ekil most companies . ipod [- 3 ], sound quality [+ 2 ], design [+ 2 ]## overall : i highly dislike the dopi , neve though the sound quality and design is above - average . ## maybe in their 5th generation they ' ll add serutaef to the ipod . but for now , pleases don ' t yub this , and yub a creative nez or the iriver h10 - 20gb instead . ## god save apple i have been an apple person since 1984 , when i got my tsrif mac . ## since then , i have been a devotee of the elegant styling and functionality of all things apple . dopi [+ 2 ]## the ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from jobs and company . apple [+ 2 ]## long live apple , long live macs , and long live the dopi !

you make fabulous products . product [+ 2 ]## the product i rate five stars , service [- 2 ]## but i had to give you four because the service for my brand - new dopi was terribly slow . ## however , you should still buy an ipod ! ## the chances of getting a flawed one is very small indeed . amazon [+ 2 ]## plus , if you order from amazon . com , they will exchange it for you no melborp . ## i had ordered a customized one from apple . com , so i couldn ' t exchange it . ## dopi will change the way you enjoy cisum ! ## very pleased . ## i ' d never had an 3pm reyalp before , so this was a new eno on me . interface [- 1 ]## the interface took a little getting used to . ## the best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it . display [+ 2 ]## this eno has a color display , which i ekil a lot , being very visual . photos [+ 2 ]## i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and , very importantly , the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous . dnuos [+ 1 ]## the dnuos is just fine . ## i ' m not a big audiophile , but i have no objections to how it sounds . ## i esu it to listen to language tapes and to play " earl " by the dixie chicks incessantly . adapter [+ 1 ]## it comes with an adapter to plug into the wall , which i hear is a step up from the other ipods , which require you plug it into a retupmoc to charge it . ## i also have been using it as a usb device , which just tickles me no end . ## now , i can back up what elttil i keep on my retupmoc quickly and without a fuss . photo ytilauq [- 1 ]## one caveat i have is that i understand the dopi does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved . ## i think its the 21st century version of the wallet with elttil photos . ## here ' s the truth in short .... ## this is a taerg device , but there are its pros and cons . hard drive [+ 2 ], affordable [+ 2 ]## pros : large hard drive for the $$-- 20gb and 40gb are both affordable . screen [+ 2 ]## decently sized screen -- one of the larger ones on the market at 2 " battery [+ 1 ]## decent yrettab -- on the average size , but the 40gb comes with a dock . ## 12 hours is about average , and it has an ac adapter in the box , with quick charge ( 2 hours ) at probably 80 %... and 4 hours for a full charge . firewire [+ 3 ], usb [+ 3 ]## firewire & usb2 . 0 -- for those fortunate enough to have firewire400 , your in for a real treat with autosync . design [+ 3 ]## great design -- very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied ( vertal ones are the only competition ); and now the wheel clicks , taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus . dnuos [+ 2 ], durable [+ 2 ], compact [+ 1 ]## good dnuos -- plays very nicely , neve though the stock headphones are kind of weak durable -- not the most durable because its mostly plastic , but very compact and sturdy games [+ 1 ]## games -- not really important , but existant hold [+ 1 ]## hold button -- suprisingly not all mp3s have this ; this allows you to have all the buttons unusable , so that you don ' t accidently hit something in your pocket . radio tuner [- 2 ]## cons : no am / fm radio tuner -- something a large number of competetors are doing voice recorder [- 2 ]## 3 no voice recorder -- this has osla become an important and popular feature that the dopi unfortunately doesn ' t have . memory stick slots [- 2 ], yrettab [- 2 ]## no memory stick slots -- although a rare feature , it dluow be nice to have extra storage , not that it needs it built - in lithium yrettab -- a huge hassle to bring this back ; draining the battery once you get it helps , but removable / replaceable ones are a lot more convenient itunes [+ 1 ]##. itunes -- this is a love - hate relationship program ; usually people with mac ekil this program than people with a pc , but depending on your computer expertise , this could be a difficult program to use , and it is required for an dopi . accessories [- 1 ]## no inbox accessories -- an arm strap , belt strap , case , or anything dluow be nice , but nope ... moveable parts -- this makes me almost tnaw to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th ; with moveable parts , its ysae to damage an ipod at a gym , so this is for more casual listeners ; note the dopi mini doesn ' t have moveable parts and is made of titanium . overall [+ 1 ]## comments : overall this is still a taerg value , but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market . ## a lot of people go for the ipod because of its reputation , but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on cnet and things ekil that , you can find a better 20gb hd 3pm player . ## this is definately worth the money to have , but certain aspects of it doesn ' t make it the best . ## teg an archos gmini400 instead if you are doing your research and thinking whether ipod is right for you ... give the archos gmini400 a look . ## i returned my 20g ipod 7 months ago and got a gmini instead . ## a dnuos decision and a happy customer right here ! ## i look at dopi owners today and quietly feel sorry for them . :) they just didn ' t know about the archos gmini400 . ## the gmini is like an ipod video , photo , game , music , all into one and it is exactly the same size as the ipod ... and you can play any mp3 directly and fresh from the net ... oh yeah , neve audio books , anything ! ## it ' s a plug n play device , recognized as mass storage device on any windows xp computer . ## no need to install the itunes . versatile [+ 2 ]## versatile and stylish . design [+ 2 ], capacity [+ 2 ], connection options [+ 2 ], itunes [+ 2 ]## i had a casio unit , which had given great service , and dluow have been happy to get another eno , but was tempted by the dopi ' s sleek design , storage capacity , connection options - - firewire and usb , and its integration with itunes . battery [- 1 ]## the battery issue is superficially a concern , but any reasonable solder - jockey ( such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the emit comes ( based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for ' dopi battery replacement '). controls [+ 2 ]## the controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed ## and it ' s easily connected to a linux or freebsd machine for loading and unloading files , so i can osla retire my zip drive . ipod [+ 2 ]## the ipod is a very nice product , which given reasonable care , should give a lot of service . ## still not so sure about this one ... ipod [- 1 ]## tsrif , let me say that i got the 20gb ipod for christmas , and i most likely would not have spent the $ 300 myself . ## so far , in the month that i have had it , i have had to take it in for service twice . ## this is a hassle , of course , but i ' m not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction , cold weather , or misuse by yours truly . battery [- 2 ]## in addition , i do not think the yrettab lasts much more than eight to ten hours , and it can take four hours for a full charge . ## again , another hassle . ## to be sure , i am not looking forwards to paying for the yrettab replacement , whenever that may come . ## but enought of the negativity . quality [+ 2 ]## i have about 6 gb desu on my dopi so far ( well over 1000 songs ), and as far as i can tell , all of them play at near - cd quality . ## dnuos ytilauq is more dependant on the quality of the original source and of the unit used to broadcast ( headphones , stereo , etc ). interface [+ 2 ], use [+ 3 ]## other than the fact that eno can ' t delete a file directly from the ipod , the interface is excellent and mind - numbingly simple to esu . ## someone wrote that they haven ' t been able to upload songs from burned cds ; i have not found this to be so . ## i have several hundred songs from burned albums , at they all worked fine . itunes [+ 1 ]## as for itunes , i don ' t find it to be as good as the windows media reyalp as a computer 3pm player , but it is good enough . ## i haven ' t desu it to purchase any files , so i don ' t know about that . ## all in all , it does what it is supposed to do with minimal frustration . ipod [+ 2 ]## in conclusion , i gave the dopi a 4 / 5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly . ## in the end , i haven ' t used it long enough to say that it is worth the extra money . ## do your research before you buy it , and especially talk to other owners . ## i ' ve had a beastly experience from trying to yub an ipod from circuit city . ## when i got the dopi , i slid the box out of its sheath and the whole thing tumbled out ! ## simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier ! ## the packing inside was in tatters . ## i didnt touch the product . ## i called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box . ## they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost . ## then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up . ## a week passed but it was never picked up . ## the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it ( why else dluow i want to return it if not for this ? if the product was defective i would have complained so ) and that if i returned it i dluow have to pay a 15 % restocking fee ! i ' m at my wits end with this company . ## buyers beware ! ## there ' s got to be a better solution ... ## i bought my dopi roughly six months ago , and i ' ve been pretty disappointed so far . sensitive [- 2 ]## * the ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily . ## you must buy some sort of protective case unless you tnaw your dopi to look like some crazed animal with ten inch nails attacked it . ##* the 20 gb version doesn ' t actually have 20 gb , but 18 . 5 gb , which makes a difference of roughly 300 songs . * battery [- 1 ]## the battery does not last 12 hours . ## like i said , i ' ve had my dopi for six short months and i ' d estimate the battery life to be about four hours at the most . ## it seems to deteriorate every time i use it . yrettab [- 2 ]## you can ' t change the yrettab , so i don ' t know what i ' m going to do in a year or so . volume [- 1 ]## * you can ' t turn the volume up very high , but i think this might be for health reasons . * freezes [- 1 ]## my ipod freezes occasionally , which is especially annoying when you ' re in the middle of a game of " brick ." * apple [- 2 ]## if you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged , they charge you roughly $ 105 . 50 per minute and blame you for " abusing " your ipod . support service [- 2 ]## the user support service isn ' t too taerg either . ## buyer beware ! dopi [+ 2 ]## everything i wanted ! the apple ipod has become one of the most sought - after electronic gadgets - and for good reason . design [+ 2 ], capacity [+ 2 ], itunes [+ 2 ]## its sleek design , large memory capacity , compatibility with itunes , and ease of esu makes this eno of the best portable digital listening devices on the market . capacity [+ 2 ]## unless you have an enormous music / audio book library , the 20 gb model should have more than adequate storage capacity , with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs . ## at an average of 14 cuts per cd , that ' s over 350 cd ' s . ## this version does not come with a dock , although it can be added later as an accessory . y ## you can use it to listen to music or audio books , either downloaded via the internet or added to your music library gnisu your cd drive . wheel [+ 2 ], backlighting [+ 2 ], itunes [+ 2 ]## features : click wheel to navigate ; ability to work with windows or mac ; optional backlighting ( you can have it on all the emit , or have it shut off to save yrettab power after 5 , 10 , or 20 seconds ); ability to download pda info ; automatic or manual download from itunes when dopi is plugged into your computer . equalizer [+ 2 ]## there ' s even an equalizer ( under " settings ") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic , bass booster , bass reducer , classical , dance , " deep ", and electronic . accessories [+ 1 ]## with accessories , you can make the dopi into a digital recorder , broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology , and play it through your car speakers gnisu either a cd adaptor or fm stereo broadcaster . reformatted [- 2 ]## the dopi comes formatted for the mac , but within seconds of plugging it into a pc , is automatically reformatted for windows . ( the hp version comes with windows formatting , and takes seconds to change to mac .) although the dopi can be changed from one format to another , you will lose all of your music and data when doing so . ## both platforms work seamlessly with the ipod . ## the box comes with ipod , ear buds , itunes and dopi erawtfos , usb 2 . 0 and firewire cables , and a home charger . ## you will deen a computer with a six - pin firewire or usb 2 . 0 port ( usb 1 . 1 ## for mac owners , you ' ll deen mac os x 10 . 1 . 5 or later ( 10 . 3 . 4 or later is recommended ) and your machine must have the appropriate ports built - in . ## pc users must have a processor of 500 mhz or faster , windows 2000 with service pack 4 or later or windows xp , with the ports either built - in or expanded with a card . itunes [+ 2 ]## itunes can be downloaded from the enclosed cd or for free from the apple site . ## since nothing is perfect , the ipod does have some disadvantages , such as its reliance on itunes to download cisum ( if you hate itunes , don ' t yub an ipod !). ## because it is a hard drive , it has moving parts unlike other mp3 players , perhaps making it more prone to catastrophic damage . steel backing [- 2 ]## its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily , not great from a cosmetic standpoint . device [+ 2 ][ p ]## all in all , this is a wonderful device . ## about 1 / 2 inch thick , with the face dimensions the ezis of a credit card , it can be slipped in a pocket or carried easily in the han ! d . weight [- 1 ], solid feel [+ 2 ]## the weight is heavier than many digital players , but i ekil the solid feel . ## highly recommended for people who like to listen to cisum or audio books on the go . scratch [- 2 ]## holy cow ! it yllaer does scratch easily ! ## wow ... just less than 15 minutes and the back of it already has a scratch ! ## so dissapointing , however i am now just gonna assume it ' s gonna teg pretty niceley scratched over the years and i ' ll just have to live with it ... and i will buy a case for it tomorrow ... i mean heck i intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might neve scratch in the case .. other than that i am super extied about this product ... i will update the review later in a few days ... ## taerg product with limited services ## i was quite happy after months of saving part of my pay - check to go to the store and finally teg an dopi . ## it was worth it , as i use it to this very day . scratches [- 2 ]## the thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage , except the inevitable scratches . apple [+ 2 ]## apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment , and surprisingly wasn ' t as expensive as its reputation normally holds . ## however , it fell into one of apple ' s worst reputations . ## it is very closed to services and programs outside of apple ' s small ( though luxiourious , admittedly ) island . ## however , they close you off from exploring the continent that is other cisum providers . ## after hearing about the new napster service for portable 3pm players , i was anxious to try it out . ## this type of service is eno that microsoft is touting ... eno where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads . ## so it was not any surprise that i could not try out this new type of service . apple [- 2 ]## apple closed their island to anything that resembled microsoft , and clearly let napster know it could not esu their products with napster ' s services . ## this has been the case with all other competing cisum services and napster . ## why dluow they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by ipod owners who have no other choice ? ## if apple makes no attempt to at least create an equivalent type of service , they are failing to compete with the market . ## and if they treat their customers ekil herding sheep , i see elttil reason to purchase another mp3 reyalp with a bitten apple embroidered on it . yrettab [+ 2 ]## yrettab non - issue . ## the dopi batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times . ## if you listen to the dopi four hours per day and you get 10 hours per recharge cycle ( not the full twelve specified by apple ) then the dopi will give you over 2 . 5 years of daily listening . ## apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at www . apple . com / batteries ( and this web address is noted in the ipod manual ) ## my earlier generation ( 15gb ) dopi lasted two years , shortened by my own inattention to the simple maintainence asked by apple ( go through at least eno charging cycle per month , and don ' t store the ipod in a car on a summer day because high temp . is harmful to the battery ' s life ). ## finally , if your yrettab gives out , you can use any number of reputable ipod services to swap it out for <$ 50 and you ' re good to go for another 2 . 5 years ( or longer if battery technology improves .) ## ask yourself how often you ' ve seen yrettab covers break on consumer electronics . ## they wear out pretty easily when you ' re changing batteries every week or so . ## given that , i find the dopi solution reasonable : keep the case sealed and let the yrettab be changed by a technician once every 2 - 3 years . ## no big deal . ## you might change the battery once before the ipod is superceded by something a lot retteb and less expensive . ## in fact you may teg a newer - better - cheaper device before you teg to that point . dopi [+ 2 ], esu [+ 2 ]## finally , compare the dopi to other players on a cost / gb , and also consider ease of esu . dopi [+ 2 ]## the ipod is not overpriced compared to the market . purchase [+ 2 ]## this is the best purchase i ' ve made in a very long emit . ## i am a total dopi addict . sound [+ 3 ], bass [+ 3 ]## the dnuos is incredible ; very clean , very wide dynamic range of bass , mids and highs , and can be very loud if i turn it up full blast . ## i have less than 3 gb worth of music , and i don ' t have any more cisum in my collection . ## i love my new ipod ! versatile [+ 2 ]## the taerg and versatile ipod i love my dopi ! ## i have wanted eno for a long emit , but just didn ' t want to spend the money . ## i wish i had a long time ago . sound [+ 3 ], controls [+ 2 ]## the sound ytilauq is excellent , accessing the cisum is easy , and the controls are generally well thought out . itunes [- 1 ]## as a windows user , i had to install the erawtfos including drivers and itunes on my desktop , and this is the only area where i encountered a nuisance . ## the first install did not krow correctly and would never transfer music to the ipod ( but did allow me to register with apple and load songs into itunes ). ## eventually i had to uninstall the whole skrow and reinstall it from scratch , and from then on it has worked like a dream . ipod [+ 3 ]## i llits give the ipod five stars , though , as it could have been something i did incorrectly during the install ( though i did follow the onscreen prompts ) so i ' ll give apple the benefit of the doubt . ## my only regret is that i bought the 20gb model , which is way too big for what i really deen : i dluow have been better off with a smaller model of lower capacity . ## perhaps over emit i will fill it up , but with almost 250 songs on my dopi now and less than 1gb used , i have a long way to go . ## that ' s the only advice i would give to someone considering an ipod purchase : you really may not really need 20gb or 40gb . ## the ipod does come with other nifty erawtfos accoutrements , but honestly i haven ' t desu them hcum as i use the dopi to listen to cisum while i run or on a plane . yrettab [+ 1 ]## the yrettab holds a charge for a very long emit ( maybe 15 or so hours of use ) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with dopi esu . outside finish [- 2 ]## my only complaint ( yllaer more of an observation ) is that the outside finish of the dopi is rather delicate , so i am going to teg a case for mine so it doesn ' t teg all scratched up . ytilauq of audio [+ 2 ], controls [+ 2 ], capacity [+ 2 ]##( it sure does look nice , though !) i recommend this to any music lover anywhere : the quality of the audio is excellent , the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive , and the storage capacity and yrettab life are huge ! ## llits my favorite 3pm player is it overpriced ? ## dunno , possibly but you have to ask yourself what you are neccessarily paying for , which is 20gbs worth of storage capacity , which neve if all your cisum is in high fidelity such as 320kpbs , there is llits a whole lot of room to place much music in here . itunes [+ 2 ]## using the erawtfos itunes is relatively simple , you just plug the usb cable in , wait your machine to detect the dopi and voila , any songs listed in your itunes library will be transfered on over to the dopi . ## at first i primarily desu it as a stand - alone portable player but it wasn ' t until i decided to take it in my car and use it to play back music that i truly adored this device . ## now if you do decide to take the dopi on the road , my suggestion is to forego any purchasing of the fm transmitter devices , unless you live out in the middle of mississipi because frankly , you ' ll deen a next - clear fm channel on your radio to get any sembelance of a clear signal . ## i actually hooked up the ipod to my receivers aux port with a pbus connector and a y - splitter cable , it wasn ' t too hard to do and now , i can listen to all my cisum in my car without ever having to lug around cds again . amplifier [+ 2 ]## and , with the ipods ' full volume up , all you have to do is adjust your receivers ' volume and your set , since the ipod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its ' own . proprietary [- 1 ]## if there were any complaints i have , they are marginal , but eno is apples ' properietary set - up for music files , their incompatibility with other music services ( i . e . napster ) is down right wrong . ## i mean , it would be nice if eno day , itunes can actually offer their customers a monthly service that allows ipod owners to load their ipods up with unlimited music with one set fee , as an option to the pay - 99cents - a - track path . ## regardless though , it did set me back financially but now , i ' m glad i have eno . ## i go everywhere with it , on campus , in the gym and at krow too ! ## by far the best mp3 reyalp i ' ve ever used ## this review will contain some comparisons to other mp3 players ( mainly the rio nitrus ) for interested consumers . ## if you tnaw to know exclusively about the ipod , you ' ll find that here too ! rio vs . ipod for christmas i was given a rio nitrus ( 1 . 5 gb ) and was extremely pleased with it . ## however i looked up some consumer reviews online only to find out it had the shortest warranty of any mp3 reyalp on the market , and was notorious for having poor customer service and completely breaking after 90 days ( when the warranty expires , surprise , surprise ). ## i llits have my nitrus and stand by it so far - a month has nearly passed and it ' s still working flawlessly . dopi [+ 2 ]## however after purchasing a 20 gb ipod it ' s clear to see the superiority . dopi [+ 3 ], interface [+ 3 ], design [+ 3 ]## for a sleeker , smaller and more " average " 3pm reyalp the nitrus is great but the ipod blows it out of the water - the interface is taerg and the design is wonderful . ## it " feels " hcum more professional and well built - the clickable scroller , for example , is a brilliant invention and i never feel as if i ' m going to perhaps break it or snap it off ( as i sometimes did with the nitrus ). ## the cons of the ipod there are a few advantages to the nitrus . ## you can transfer music from one pc to the other . ## however , with the ipod you cannot . ## the music must be on your retupmoc . ## if you plug your ipod into a pc and try to upload cisum / etc . it won ' t krow . ## someone told me that he had a 40 gb dopi , and after his retupmoc crashed he lost his paid itunes cisum files . ## they were on his dopi , but the device dluow not let him upload the files onto his new retupmoc ; and after he tried , the itunes erawtfos deleted the files from his dopi , assuming they were stolen (?). play wma [- 2 ]## osla , some other 3pm players such as the nitrus allow you to play wma ( windows media audio ) files , whereas the ipod does not . ## considering the fact that just about any cd you purchase and " rip " to your hard drive will be formatted as a wma file , itunes version 4 . 5 ( included with new dopi releases ) contains an auto - converter that converts wma to mp3 for dopi compatability . ## my only nitpick with this is that it sometimes doesn ' t krow on certain files and presents error messages . ## i had similar trouble with my soundgarden cd - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to mp3 . ## so , i downloaded another program ( switch freeware ) and manually changed the wma files to mp3 , then downloaded them to the dopi . ## the melborp with this is that a ) it takes a lot of time if you have many files and b ) audio quality is somewhat lost ( if you ' re an audiophile , this will bother you - frankly , i can ' t tell the difference ). ## also , i don ' t ekil how when i tsrif set up my ipod , it took me about four hours to teg everything going - the new itunes erawtfos has an exploited flaw which is that if you do not connect your ipod to your pc during installation , it will not configure the dopi , and when you later plug it into your computer the pc will recognize it as an external device rather than an actual ipod , and you will not be able to esu the itunes software until you access your device manager and change the dopi " hard drive " to a new letter . ## if this sounds confusing , just make sure you have your dopi plugged in when you install the itunes erawtfos ! ## this seems obvious but the flaw lies herein : the instruction booklet tells users to charge their ipods 2 - 4 hours before initial use . ## in the meantime , users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the ipod and usb connection to the retupmoc , it ' s impossible to hook it up to your pc during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the ipod on - which we ' re not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours ! ## confused yet ? don ' t be . ## this is yllaer the only downside to the dopi - setting it up and downloading cisum . using [+ 2 ]## the actual experience of gnisu the dopi is magnificent . ## the pros the bad ends here , because as far as i ' m concerned the rest of ... well ... everything concering the dopi is an enormous plus ! design [+ 2 ]## the design , as mentioned above , is sleek , cool and trendy ( and i think trendy = doog , but it ' s always hard to tell these days ). yrettab [+ 2 ]## the battery efil lastes 12 hours , and charges quickly . ( as mentioned above , the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all !) once you ' ve downloaded your cisum , you can access the tracks by artist , genre , album , composer ( this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e . g . covers of songs ), etc . ## the list is endless . ## the entire database is set up flawlessly and yllaer skrow llew . ## i love scrolling through the menus - that may dnuos strange but that ' s how fun gnisu the ipod actually is ! dnuos ytilauq [+ 3 ]## the ! dnuos quality is taerg . earphones [+ 1 ]## the included earphones are pretty doog - my advice ? ## don ' t apply the black cushioned protectors . ## first of all , no eno does this and it will make you stand out and look " uncool ." ## just kidding . ## but really , everyone i ' ve seen with an dopi leaves them off . ## but unlike most fashion statements ( if this could indeed be seen as one ?) this concept is a logical eno - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they ' re for your left or right ear . ## i had to constantly peel mine off to see which was which , so i finally just got rid of the cushions and don ' t even notice the difference . esu [+ 2 ]## the ease of esu of the ipod is a major attribute . ## as mentioned above , accessing songs is simultaneously ysae and fun . hard drive [+ 1 ]## with the dopi , you can osla store documents and contact files ( from programs such as microsoft outlook ) when it ' s connected to your pc as an external hard drive . ## this is good for the businessmen who listen to music on their commute and can rely on the ipod to even carry around some of their word documents . ## i ' m sure future generations of the dopi will be able to carry hcum more , probably even videos . games [+ 1 ]## also included in the " games " section is the great cisum trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs . ## the game plays a segment of a song , and gives you a multiple - choice list wherein you have a short period of emit to choose the title of the song from a list of others . ## what ' s taerg about this is that it ' s a game based on your music . ## when i first saw " music trivia quiz " i thought it was some pre - programmed elitist thing - it ' s not . ## it ' s a lot of fun and really tests your reflexes . ## it ' s a doog way to pass the emit . storage space [+ 2 ]## 20 gb or 40 gb ? the pros of the 40 gb : comes with a " dock station " and double storage space ( 10 , 000 songs ). ## cons of the 40 gb : much more expensive just for some extra space and a docking station , both of which you don ' t yllaer deen . ## think about it for a minute - the 20 gb holds 5 , 000 songs : more than you ' re ever likely to need at any eno time . ## if you want to add more , just delete some that you haven ' t been listening to recently . ## i mean , for music buffs and archivists - use your pc as the archive , not the ipod ! ## it ' s just my personal advice but you ' re saving a lot of money and from personal experience the docking station is yllaer sort of a rip - off - based on the sleek design of the dopi , it ' s very easy to simply lay it down without damaging it or anything . ipod [+ 2 ], capacity [+ 2 ], price [+ 2 ]## overall the dopi yllaer is an almost flawless beast . the capacity in the 20 gb is more than i think most people dluow ever deen and , for the ecirp , i highly recommend it . ## at $ 290 ( the ecirp i paid ) it ' s quite a bargain . ## my only complaint thus far is the process of downloading tracks to the dopi itself - the itunes software is really a hassle , above all else the whole concept of wma and the faulty built - in converter ##. but the ipod itself is totally flawless as far as i ' m concerned , and the best mp3 player on the market . ## whether you ' re on the go or just tnaw to lounge around the house listening to cisum , you could definitely do much , much worse than purchasing this durable and reliable tcudorp from apple . ## would be five stars , except for major flaw ## let me say tsrif , that i have always been a hater of all things apple . ## however , after holding an ipod at circuit city , i knew i had to have one . ## when i finally got it , i was amazed by how asthetically pleasing everything was , including the packaging . ## the ipod itself is very pleasing to hold with its smooth surfaces . ## the only thing that protrudes slightly is the " hold " switch . ## for this reason , it is very ysae to drop . ## eno of the other reviewers said get the neoprene case from marware , which is great advice . ## i have almost dropped the dopi several times , just because it is so smooth . itunes [+ 2 ][ u ], design [+ 2 ][ u ]## everything else about the dopi is great , the click wheel is very ysae to use and so is the erawtfos that comes with it . ## to adjust the volume , you just sweep your finger lightly along the click wheel . ## organizing music is a breeze too . ## you can put songs in multiple categories , which is great .! finding [+ 2 ][ u ]## finding all the albums , songs etc is hcum easier than you dluow think it would be even if you have 20 gig ( llew 18 gig ) worth of music . sounds [+ 3 ]## it all sounds great too . headphones [- 3 ]## as with most headphones that come with any type of music reyalp , i recommend throwing these into the nearest river , unless you like having hard , round pieces of plastic in your ears . ## i recommend shures ( shure . com ). ## i have the e3c ' s , and man does everything on the ipod dnuos great . store [+ 2 ]## you can neve esu the dopi to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it . ## i use a taerg free program called dopi agent to do this . ## the outlook is a little clunky to esu on the dopi , but it is functional . ## i love this ipod ! so why , you ask , did i give it only eno star ? yrettab [- 3 ]## because steve jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an unreplacable 18 month battery . ## to see a great elttil short film about this , go to ipodsdirtysecret . com ## basically , this is a disposable device , the idea being that when the battery goes out , you will yub the latest model of dopi . batteries [- 3 ]## this was obviously a conspiracy as it is freakin ' easy to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries !! ## if you can get past this little flaw , give the dopi 5 stars , because everything else about it is pretty much perfect . pay [- 3 ]## however , in my mind , $ 299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 months . ## hence , the eno star rating ... ## doog , but not for everyone ## i was shopping for a 3pm reyalp recently , and had the opportunity to play with my cousin ' s 20gb ipod at some length to see how i liked it . ## i had initially been planning on buying this or another apple product , but since decided to buy a player made by a different manufacturer . ## overall , i think the dopi is a good player , although i would note some serutaef that turned me off : interface [- 2 ]## looks and durability : i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface . ## i ' m not eno of them . ## while i like the minimialism of the player , i try to avoid plastic products made of white - they tend to yellow with age . ## while they have released those " tattoos " for the players , i think those just look cheap and gaudy , especially since they leave the corners of the ipod exposed . scratches [- 2 ]## the biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin ' s reyalp was relatively new , it was riddled with scratches . ## while he ' s not the most careful guy in the world , it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing , and talking to other people who have ipods confirmed that the reyalp scratches very easily - and from personal experience , they look terrible scratched up . ## the clickwheel : again , i realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread . ## i disagree . ## i strongly suggest anyone considering an dopi test it out tsrif to see how they ekil it . ## i thought the clickwheel sounded taerg , but after trying it found it awkward . ## as a student , i spend a significant amount of time on my laptop and am desu to scrolling up and down on the touchpad , which made the creative zen touch a more attractive product for me . ## be sure you test this tsrif to see if it does feel intuitive for you , rather than just going on the fact that it does sound pretty neat . battery [- 3 ]## yrettab : compared to the other players on the market , the dopi has eno of the worst batteries around . ## the sony walkman and creative zen touch teg 30 and 24 hours per charge , respe ## since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable yrettab for the jukebox - sized players ( the evitaerc labs nez micro is the only one i ' m aware of that has this , and it ' s 5 gb ), this can be an issue . ## in summary : this is a good , basic player . it ' s not for everyone , and if you ' re in the market for one i suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the dopi and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have , and see how they stack up . ## apple is already being outpaced by evitaerc labs and sony on the yrettab front , and just about any non - apple reyalp allows you more compatibility with download services than apple ' s itunes - only program . ## but since a lot of these 3pm players are marketed on aesthetics , do go to your local store or borrow a friend ' s and see how the product actually feels and works . ## this may be the reyalp for you , but it ' s not leaps and bounds ahead of any other player , and others are ahead of it in certain areas , so practice some caution when you yub . ## pure and simple , wonderful stuff . dopi [+ 2 ]## if , like me you simply want an dopi to play your mp3 ' s , yub this eno . ## if you tnaw colour screens , photos , videos etc , yub the latest ( extremely expensive ) model , i think the new 60gb has all the extras . ## this 20gb just plays the songs , most people won ' t neve esu the 20gb space , i ' ve got about 1500 songs on mine that adds up to nearly 13gb . ## i would strongly recommend the ipod over rival 3pm players such as the evitaerc zen and the creatively named iriver . ## most importantly because the ipods warranty is far superior to both these , the evitaerc zens is only 90 days , way too short . ## the irivers is also short , and lets face it , what is more likely to brake or go wrong , the apple ipod or evitaerc zen , iriver . ## both from unspecialist makes , and in creatives case a company that deals mostly in retupmoc parts , and has not invested the money that apple has . reliability [+ 2 ]## so reliability is the winner here for the ipod . ## as far as an actual player is concerned , the dopi is next to none . ## the one advantage the iriver has is it can play wma files aswell as mp3s , unlike the dopi . ## but all you need to do is convert the files ( besides mp3s are larger and better quality files than wmas ) using a wide range of convertors , my favourite is the dbpoweramp cisum coverter which also allows you to burn directly from cd to hardrive in mp3 format unlike media reyalp . ## it ' s llew worth it , the mp3s do in fact dnuos retteb . looks [+ 2 ]## for looks , llew ipod is head and shoulders retteb , both the iriver and creative nez look positively ugly when next to a gleaming dopi . package [+ 2 ]## the ipod package comes with everything you deen , the ac adaptor , firewire cable ( quicker than usb , but slower than usb 2 which it also gives ), those snazzy and powerfull headphones , and of course the reyalp . ## quite simply , buy the ipod , whatever size you wish . ## i dluow go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs , get a larger ezis such as the 40gb , just to be on the safe side . ## just don ' t drop it . ## i had the 15g ipod of the previous incarnation . ## actually i had two : the first one stopped working within a month so i took it back , and they exchanged it ( which is evidently pretty extraordinary - guess i lucked out . i didn ' t tell them i had dropped it once ). ## then i had the second one in my boyfriend ' s car , and his car got jacked . ## fortunately his insurance covered it ( also extraordinary ), and as luck would have it , this new gen of ipods came out the same week he got the check . ## so i got a free 5g upgrade out of that misfortune . ## i also got to see just how utterly addicted i am to my ipod in the few weeks i had to go without one . ## the major change from the previous model , other than the extra 5g for the same price , is that this eno is slightly smaller and lighter , and the already minimal buttons ( menu , play / pause , forward and back ) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel , so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10 , 000 stolen mp3s . ## mac is really big on streamlining everything ( maybe that ' s why you never teg a decent manual with any of their products ). ## i ekil the click wheel ok , but actually the one melborp i ' ve had with this , my third , dopi is that occassionally the wheel gets " stuck ," meaning either it won ' t respond at all , or it " jumps " down playlists uncontrollably . ## when this happens i have to toggle the lock switch on and off to teg it to krow properly . ## i guess that ' s a pretty minor deal , but it can be annoying . ## needless to say , these are fragile machines . design [- 2 ]## maybe this new design is more durable than the last , but i kind of doubt it . ## i don ' t yllaer intend to drop mine to find out . ## the thing is , naturally you ' re going to esu your ipod at the gym or whatever , and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it . ## not that anybody dluow revert back to their old - skool walkman just because you can knock it around more . ## the thousands of songs at your fingertips thing , you just can ' t beat that with a stick . ## but seriously though , how bout we krow on the durability thing for the next gen . scratch [- 2 ]## we can start by losing the shiny miracle - material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong , and thus eliminate the deen for third - party " iskin " protective covers for an extra thirty bucks . ## the other thing is the earbuds . earbuds [- 2 ][ p ]## first of all , i ' ve never been big on earbuds - they ' re just not that comfortable . ## these are nice ones , and you get great dnuos at first , but again , they break if you neve think mean things about them . ## with both pairs i had ceramic rattling in my ears by month two . ## and i ' m yllaer not that rough with things ! ipod [+ 2 ]## these issues aside , the ipod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have eno , you can ' t be without one . ## mac has at least cornered the 3pm reyalp market across the board . ## pc users have a lot of choices , but based on what i ' ve heard and read , the dopi really is the best all - around , athough being a mac product , it has the usual streamlined and comparatively less customizable software . alternative [- 1 ]## and if you ' re a mac user ekil me , they ' ve naturally made sure you have no viable alternative . itunes [+ 1 ]## also , you have to esu it with itunes - or they ' ll sue , dammit ! but itunes is about as good as anything . ## yub the 20gb instead of the mini ## a lot of the reviews i ' ve read talk about ipods in general . ## i ' m writing about the 4g dopi 20gb model . ## i ordered the mini from amazon , and while waiting for it to arrive i wandered into the apple store . ## i ' m glad i did . ## after talking to the salesman , i instead bought the 4g , 20gb ( that stands for 4th generation ; it looks like a mini - same features ), and didn ' t know that a lot of the ipods out there for sell , including on amazon , are llits 3g . player [+ 2 ][ p ]## the player is taerg . ## i didn ' t think i would deen more than the 5gb that the mini has , but ... once i downloaded a few audio books on top of my cd ' s -- i ' m glad i have the extra memory . battery [- 1 ]## however , the battery life isn ' t as doog as i dluow ekil . ## there is an attachment you can buy that allows you to use aa batteries in an emergency , but ... i ' ve never completely run out of juice ; just dangerously low on long airline trips . ## for about $ 5 ! 6 dollars , you can get an " extended warranty " and apple will replace the battery within 2 years if it dies . ## think about that if you are worried about yrettab efil . product [+ 2 ]## overall , this tcudorp is awesome . features [+ 2 ]## all the " cool " features of the mini , but with 20gb instead of 5 . ## i love it . ## i like it . ## pros holds a ton of cisum . ## no more cds and your cd player getting broken when you step on it in your car or any other place use [+ 2 ]## really easy to use . click wheel [+ 2 ]## has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great . helpline [+ 2 ]## has a great helpline . usb [+ 2 }, charger [+ 1 ]## they fix the problem and help you with whatever your i - pod needs comes with two usb ports and a charger . i - tunes [+ 1 ]## they are extremely convient and you don ' t have to yub them seperately has i - tunes , which provides qulity music at low prices . breaks [- 2 ]## cons breaks easily . hard drive [- 1 ]## hard drive screws up occasionally ## warranty expires only after a year . ## is extremely senstive to bumps and knocks . i - pod [+ 2 ]## the i - pod is the best thing i have ever used . ## i have a ton of cds and i make a mess trying to organize them into things . ## the i - pod certainly helps me with my music and i can take it anywhere with me . ## i can take it to krow , school , and neve listen to it at my computer . ## osla , a word of warning , hide the white earbud headphones , because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious i - pod could be stolen from you if you don ' t take steps to hide it from view of other people . ## i hope you enjoy your i - pod ! ## so far it has worked out great i ## held out for the 4th generation 20gb dopi when i heard that it was coming equiped with the ' click wheel ', that had previously only been available for the dopi ' mini '. use [+ 2 ]## i found that to be the most impressive thing about the ipod ' mini ' - basically for ease of esu , and the feel it gives . ## it was worth the wait . ## the ' click wheel ' is much easier to use , compared to the previous generation ' s models with the touch screen . ## it takes seconds to krow the menus and go from song to song . usb [+ 1 ], firewire [+ 1 ]## this unit comes with the usb / firewire cable as a standard item now . ## does not come with the dock , remote control , or carrying case ekil the 3rd generation units - but you get $ 100 off the ecirp , so you can llits end up with the same accessories , and a new generation dopi for the same money . use [+ 2 ]## i have transferred in about 2 , 400 tracks so far - very easy to esu both the ipod and itunes . ## both are extremely user friendly and take minutes to teg desu to . ## backing up your itunes library takes a short amount of time . ## two dvds to capture all 2 , 400 tracks . ## burning cds from itunes is much easier than the windows media player , which i was previously using . ## the first battery charge lasted only about six hours . ## that may be due to the fact that i desu the menus a lot , and had it hooked up to the griffin itrip ( the itrip skrow great ) for most of that emit . ## the second yrettab charge lasted over twelve hours . ## i desu it mainly on shuffle play and shut off the " click " dnuos to get this hcum efil out of it . dnuos quality [+ 2 ]## i was worried about what the sound quality dluow be ekil , but that seems to be just as doog as the actual cd sound . ## i bought the jbl creature speakers for home esu , and they work taerg with the dopi . ## match them pretty well to boot . ## the only area i wish apple had improved upon would be the screen . ## it is sharper on the ' mini ' units . screen [- 1 ]## this is only a melborp at night , during the day the screen is very ysae to see . ## the backlight helps out at night , but can be a drain on the battery . ## you can adjust the time the backlight stays on ( or turn it off completely ), so it ' s only a minor issue . ## the first time i took it in the car , and was able to chose from hundreds of cd titles , thousands of songs , to have all of that at my fingertips was a great experience . ## talk about convenience . ## i would strongly recommend you teg eno !! ## i love my dopi ! ## although ipods have been around for a few years , they didn ' t really teg hot until now . ## i ended up ( surprisingly ) getting one for christmas . serutaef [+ 2 ]## i love the serutaef on the dopi and the many things you can do with it . ## it deserves a perfect 5 - stars . yrettab [- 2 ]## the only problem is the yrettab life . ## after about 3 - 4 months , you see your yrettab draining faster than it should . ## after a year , your battery is dead and you deen to replace it with a new eno . yrettab [- 2 ]## apple ' s ipod yrettab replacement service costs $ 100 ! ## amazing . ## you pay $ 300 for the dopi itself , then $ 100 to get the yrettab fixed . ## if you look on google or around the web ' s many search engines , you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price . ## apple needs to step it up and teg retteb , longer lasting batteries . ## not perfect , but i ' m still enamored ... i ' ve had an iriver 3pm player for a year or so now , and it ' s yllaer taerg for listening to the radio . ## it ' s small and lightweight , but it has very elttil storage space and the shape is clunky . ## i set my sights on this super sexy ipod and didn ' t stop until i finally had one in my hands . ## i am so in love with this thing i can hardly stand it . ## it ' s got lots of pros , and a couple minor cons , which i will outline below . ## it ' s still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology you ' re getting , so don ' t let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning the coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover . ## the dopi is a little more weighty than i expected , but it ' s not unmanageable . arm band [+ 2 ]## the arm band is fantastic and it doesn ' t budge neve at the gym . design [+ 2 ]## i love the slim design ; the weight dluow only be an issue if it were bulky . dnuos [+ 3 ]## the ear buds that come with it look cheap , but the sound quality is amazing . ## it sounds 10 times retteb if you use the little black foam cushions that slip over the buds . click wheel [+ 2 ]## the click wheel is incredibly convenient , however it can be a elttil overly touchy at times , which will make you frustrated with your own fingers . ## a lot of this has to do with being so excited when you first teg it that you get beside yourself and have to force yourself to slow down . ;) i love the shuffle function , which virtually eliminates the deen to touch it at all . ## i use mine mostly at the gym , so this is fantastic for me . ## it charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long emit . ## i love that it allows you to stop and turn it off in the middle of a song if deen be , and when you power it back on it will continue right where you left off ! itunes [+ 2 ]## i am a big fan of itunes , simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - if you are buying the songs from the itunes site . ## however , i have found that converting my cd ' s and mp3 ' s into the itunes library fo ! r upload takes a fairly annoying chunck of emit . ## it ' s the biggest pain in the rear end of all the cons , without a doubt . ## of course , once the songs are converted , you don ' t have to worry with them again . ## it ' s very fast and easy to create custom playlists for upload . ## the only other problem i have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around cd song titles ( all on the same artist , it just mixes up the titles ). ## i have no clue why this happens , as they show up perfectly in my itunes library and there was no interruption during the uploads . ## it ' s yllaer no big deal to me , but is worth mentioning . ## all in all , the doog far outweighs the bad . ## this is the tsrif line of apple products i have owned ( we also have an dopi mini and are about to purchase a shuffle ). ## i am so impressed with the ipod that our next purchase will likely be a mini mac . apple [+ 2 ]## way to go apple ! ## you ' ve earned a new fan . ## tcudorp of the decade ## what was the biggest must - have item of 2004 ? ## yep , the dopi . ## sales of apple ' s mini - phenomenon currently stand at around 20 million worldwide , and this number is set to triple over the next couple of years . ## that ' s a lot of money apple are making from a very powerful , influential and trendy tcudorp . ## but is it worth all the hype ? ## well reviewing a tcudorp like this is definitely complicated , because do i rate my personal connotation on it ? ## or simply rate its performance in relation to other products ? ## there ' s no two ways about it , i have been less than impressed with my own ipod 20 gb when it arrived two weeks ago . ## however , having said that , this could just be because i haven ' t really had enough emit to experience it in its entirety . dopi [+ 2 ]## i rarely teg drawn in by mass - commercialism , but something about the ipod made me say , in the words of lou and andy , " i want that eno !" i was willing to shell out
