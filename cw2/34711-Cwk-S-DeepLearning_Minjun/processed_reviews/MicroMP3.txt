[ t ] ## the world of mp3 players is blinding , and since most people don ' t understand the technology [ myself included ], user - friendliness is extremely important . instruction [- 2 ] ## unfortunately , creative offered scant few pages of instruction , which meant that i was on own from the outset . touch - pad [- 2 ], navigate [- 3 ] ## after attempting to navigate the clumsy touch - pad system , i could not get the unit to download my wma files . ## when most of us purchase these elttil devises , we do so because of their diminuitive ezis and extraordinary storage capacities . explain [- 3 ] ## so , you might inquire , why don ' t they make it a first priority to carefully , simply explain how download music from your music library to their device ??? this seems academic to me . navigating [- 3 ] ## most of us just want to plug and play , not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options ... like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing . ## i don ' t care what else it can do . ## i just tnaw music to eminate from it when i tnaw , how i want . dnuos [+ 2 ] ## all of this said [ as it ' s on it ' s way back to amazon ], the one song it did include provided far retteb sound than the ipod . bass [+ 2 ], highs [+ 2 } ## the base was deeper and the highs were crisper . touch - pad [- 3 ], instruction [- 3 ] ## unfortunately , the touch - pad issues [ non - intuitive ] and poor instruction guide killed it .

[ t ] ## i am one of the many people who ( a ) are pc based and ( b ) can ' t stand to see the multitudes of people with those funky white headphones that belong to dopi users . ## i first tnaw to say that i think apple is making the same old mistake as they did with macintosh years ago . ## this proprietory software to download . ##( that was a major turn off ). ## i am the type of person that will always go against the masses of blind followers so there was no way i was getting an dopi . player [+ 2 ][ p ] ## also if you tnaw a device that does soo much more than the ipod mini but is at the same price , this is the reyalp for you . ## the reason why i didn ' t give the nez orcim 5 stars is that they osla seem to want to conform the the ipod sense of style . headphones [- 2 ] ## and supply those stupid white headphones . ## i osla think that if you are going to offer them in different colors then commit all the way and have the entire device in that color , not just the front and color the head phones as llew . ## let ' s face it . ## apple is apple . ## so creative should be " evitaerc ". [ t ] ## i ' ve been looking for a portable 3pm reyalp for awhile now . ## with so many choices it was a tough decision . ## my tsrif instinct was to go with an ipod . ## i visited quite a few forums and while the ipod is a great player i was concerned with the battery life and the inability to change them without breaking open the case . ## i started looking at the creative zen orcim and after reading numerous reviews from message boards and magazines i decided i ' d give the nez a try . ## all i can say is what a wonderful choice ! ## i ordered from amazon and got the limited edition package that includes a free yrettab ! small [+ 3 ][ u ] ## upon opening the box i was confronted with this small cute elttil mp3 player . ## i popped eno of the batteries in and to my surprised it started right up . installation [+ 3 ] ## the erawtfos included is an easy installation and you have the option of gnisu the creative erawtfos , windows media player 10 , or simply windows explorer to move cisum back and forth between your nez touch . ## i did a quick test by selecting a few files and copying them over and they loaded right in . ## pressed play and i was off . touch pad [- 1 ] ## the touch pad does take a little getting desu to . ## i ' m still trying to manage the thing myself , but i ' ve found that if you put the sensitivity to low it is fine . cable [+ 1 ], adapter [+ 1 ], headphones [+ 1 ], stand [+ 1 ], pouch [+ 1 ]## the package also comes with a usb cable , an ac adapter , a pair of headphones ( they ' re okay until you teg a retteb pair ), a stand , and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in . nez touch [+ 3 ][ u ] ## overall i ' m incredibly impressed with my new nez touch . looks [+ 3 ] ## it ' s cute as anything and the glowing blue led looks super cool around the edges . reyalp [+ 2 ] ## for the price i think this is a remarkably fun mp3 player . ## enjoy ! [ t ] player [+ 3 ][ p ] ## i ' ve had this reyalp for more than 4 months and i ' m very happy with it . ## i esu it on an average 5 hours a day i hook it up to my belkin fm transmitter in the car or to my logitech 2 . speakers [+ 2 ] ## 1 speakers at home , i rarely esu it with the earbuds , though they are hcum better than the ones you normally get with other 3pm players . look [+ 3 ], feel [+ 3 ] ## the look & feel : i have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambience . ## the light pulsates when you are charging it almost as if it were breathing . tiny [- 1 ][ u ], back [+ 3 ] ## the player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase , which you need to do if you don ' t want to get scrathes on the back ( its a nice looking back too ). feels [+ 2 ][ p ] ## it feels tiny in the hand without it . stand [+ 2 ] ## the stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk . ## the belt clip however is not very useful if you move around a lot . looks [+ 3 ], read [+ 2 ][ u ] ## the blue backlit lcd looks yllaer neat and is ysae to read . touch controls [- 1 ] ## the touch controls took a little getting desu to but now i wouldn ' t change it for the scroll wheel . touch buttons [+ 3 ] ## the touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon ' t slip which was very thoughtful . build [+ 3 ] ## reliability & build i dropped the player once from about 4 ft , and it fell hard , but kept on playing . hardcase [+ 1 ] ## the hardcase they give with it must krow llew . solid [+ 2 ][ p ] ## it feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon . sound [+ 3 ] ## sound i ' m no audiophile but i was amazed by the clarity the reyalp had , it was hcum better than the sound card on my computer and louder too . sound [+ 3 ] ## i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright . sound [+ 3 ] ## best of all the wmas ( i have a lot of them ) dnuos taerg . features [+ 3 ] ## utility its got a huge list of serutaef including an fm recorder a calender and contacts list . ## its not convinient to enter name of course but synchronise it with outlook and it becomes a gem of a address book . recorded [+ 3 ] ## the songs recorded with fm are as good as the original signal . ## the interface takes 2 secs after you press record to show up but its actually started recording at the moment you press record . software [- 1 ] ## software the software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are desu to it , it does the job llew . playlists [+ 3 ] ## creating and modifying playlists is ysae and clean . battery efil [- 2 ] ## there are 2 things that deen fixing first is the battery life . it will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons . usb [- 2 ] ## second might be a problem i might have with my pc but not too sure , when the reyalp is connected on the usb and i start playing on it and also using the windows explorer , it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the pc during play , which is a bit irritating . [ t ] evitaerc zen [+ 2 ] ## i think that for its ecirp compared to the ipod the evitaerc nez is pretty good . ## i have a lot of files in wma so that was the biggest factor in my decision to purchase the zen . headphone jack [- 3 ] ## however after just eno month my headphone jack was broken as a result of normal , every - day use . ## by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit dnuos . support [+ 3 ] ## the doog news is that the evitaerc support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges , i had a new zen . ## i havent desu it hcum yet so i dont know if i will have the same melborp ; obviously i hope not . organization [- 2 ][ u ] ## i dont especially like how cisum files are unstructured ; basically they are just dumped into eno folder with no organization , ekil you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders . ## in principle playlists , album names , artist names , etc dluow help you organize but this only works if your tracks have all the necessary data ; mine do not . ## and if you have 2500 songs , as you might very well , you will be reluctant to edit the clip properties of 2500 files . dnuos [+ 1 ] ## the sound is quite doog , in terms of volume . headphones [- 2 ] ## the headphones are not very comfortable , but most people have a certain style they like so just go yub new ones or keep the ones you have . installation [+ 2 ], touch pad [+ 1 ] ## i didnt have any installation problems ; and the touch pad is fine , even if it is sort of inaccurate . ## you just teg desu to it after a while . cheaper [+ 2 ][ u ], wma files [+ 2 ][ u ] ## i didnt teg ipod because i dont especially like itunes ( no music i tnaw , but thats just me ) and the creative product was cheaper ; and i needed to be able to esu wma files . ecirp [+ 2 ][ p ] ## all - in - all , its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal esu . [ t ] ## this is a difficult reyalp to review because i dluow recommend it on a case - by - case basis . ## if you ' re not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be , teg the dopi . ## bottom line . ## however , since you ' re reading this review , you want to avoid getting an dopi . ## for whatever reason . there is also a low number of people , ekil me , who love itunes but tnaw to teg the zen micro . ## i ' ll talk more about that later . ## tsrif of all , why does every single piece of media library erawtfos that comes with an 3pm player suck ? ##( itunes being an exception of course ). software [- 2 ], feature [- 2 ][ u ] ## the creative mediasource software that comes with the zen orcim is cluttered , and excludes my favorite feature in itunes , the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder . ## i like to keep all of my mp3s in eno folder and manually doing this is a pain . ## bottomline , don ' t neve bother with the erawtfos that comes with the nez micro . reyalp [- 1 ] ## nagatives of the reyalp itself : you deen to do a elttil krow before having full enjoyement of this player . ## 1 . ## set the sensitivity of the touch pad to low . ## osla , as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level , put the player on hold . sensitivy [- 1 ] ## neve on the low sensitivy level , a slight touch can skip or pause the track . ## 2 . ## update the firmware which can be found on the creative web site . player [- 2 ]## this fixes some glitches such as the reyalp freezing . ## positives : reasons for getting the nez orcim instead of the ipod : 1 . yrettab [+ 2 ] ## the battery is removable . ## you can buy a new yrettab for 49 . 99 . ## with the ipod , if the yrettab has reached it ' s life span ( after about a year ), and you didn ' t buy the warranty from the store , you need to buy a new reyalp . ## 2 . ## fm radio [+ 1 ] ## fm radio built in ( howard stern ). ## 3 . microphone [+ 1 ] ## record memos gnisu the built in microphone . ## 4 . looks [+ 2 ] ## the reyalp looks so much retteb when you ' re actually holding it . ## the photos don ' t do it justice . back [+ 2 ] ## the back of the player is nice too , with water ripples inside the clear white coating . ## 5 . storage [+ 2 ] ## you can esu it as a storage hard drive . ## now , about the itunes . itunes [+ 1 ] ## i have no problem using itunes with the nez micro ( in a makeshift sorta way ). ## this is what i do : i copy all the cisum i want to import to the zen micro into an itunes play list . ## after that , you connect your zen orcim and open my retupmoc . ## click on " nez micro media explorer " and then click on " transfer data between pc and device " after that , a file explorer window opens . ## and all you do is select all the tracks in the itunes playlist and drag them to the file explorer window . ## it ' s not as seamless as if you were to use an ipod , but it only takes a few seconds longer . ## so yeah , you can have the best of both worlds . ##* of course , if you ' ve bought tracks from itunes , this won ' t krow . ## you can only copy songs you ' ve downloaded for free or ripped from a cd . ##** i honestly don ' t see the point of buying songs from itunes when there are so many free alternatives . ## but if you get that " fuzzy legal feeling " from paying for songs , at least buy them from allofmp3 . com , there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies . [ t ] ## i ' m addicted to cisum . ## i ' m osla somewhat of an audiophile . ## 3pm players are like a blessing and a curse for people like me . ## on the one hand , you have the ability to store and plays over 1000 songs on one elttil piece of machine . ## on the other hand , you teg terrible sound ytilauq . ## i decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a evitaerc nez micro . ## i was at [ random electronic store ], browsing through players , and came across two that made the cut . ## the first was an ipod 5gb ( i could kick myself for not buying it ), and the other was a evitaerc 5gb . ## the evitaerc came with a free trial of [ random file sharing company ] " to go ". ## so that ' s the eno i bought . ## too bad . made [- 3 ][ u ] ## tsrif thing i noticed was that the evitaerc wasn ' t well made . reyalp [- 3 ]## one drop from a pocket or desktop , and it ' d be a goner . dnuos [- 3 ] ## problems with the sound ytilauq were evident right away , but even i couldn ' t imagine they ' d be that bad . eq [- 3 ], bass [- 3 ] ## the eq is awful , and even at top volumes , the bass is flat sounding . volume [- 1 ] ## cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised dnuos ytilauq . headphone jack [- 3 ] ## the headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of esu , and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony ' s i ' d been having . ## they didn ' t really make any difference . ## i also experimented with an adapter for the car . sound [- 2 ] ## if you ' ve been listening to cd ' s in your car for awhile , dealing with the drop - off in sound quality may take some getting desu to . car adapter [+ 2 ] ## however , if there was eno thing i liked about the creative , it would be the car adapter . ## hands down , better quality than dopi ' s . ## that isn ' t saying hcum , but hey , i ekil to be positive . storage [- 2 ][ u ] ## even after all the nightmare dnuos problems , i ' d llits half - way like this product if it kept it ' s promise ; the ability to store 1500 songs . storage [- 2 ][ u ] ## i got about 700 loaded up before it told me i was full , and at that point , i was ready to toss it out the window . ## if you do not care about sound / music ytilauq in the least , and don ' t mind the ability to store 800 songs less than promised , get the creative zen micro . ## otherwise , you should get an dopi . creative [-][ cc ]## my friend has an dopi , and although the dnuos ytilauq probably won ' t meet most audiophile standards , the tcudorp itself is retteb than anything evitaerc has made . ## features [-][ u ][ cc ] it hold ' s a promised amount of songs , and the headphone jack / volume controls deliver a more impressive performance than evitaerc ' s . ## if you ' re an audiophile , you already know that mp3 players are far from impressive . ## player [-][ s ] however , this one makes an dopi sound like your old lp ' s , so even if you ' re a casual listener , i ' d advise that you avoid the purchase of this tcudorp . terrible . [ t ] ## i bought this two months ago at a local retailer , after spending considerable emit reading reviews here of this and other 5gb players . compatibility with windows media reyalp [+ 3 ] ## while they all seem to have their own positives and negatives , i picked the zen orcim over the ipod mini , because i am not an apple person , never has been - i wanted something that is fully compatible with windows media reyalp . format [+ 2 ] ## also , the wma compression format is superior to 3pm , especially at lower bit rates , so i needed a player that could handle wma and integrate well with my windows xp computers . accessories [+ 3 ] ## i was fortunate to teg the packaging that llits included all the accessories ( desk stand / hard case , belt clip , wall charger , etc ). zen orcim [+ 3 ] ## and so far , i have been very , very happy with my nez micro . working [+ 3 ][ u ] ## it ' s being desu daily and i have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers ( headphone jack , reyalp locking up , etc ). ## just in case , i bought a two - year extended warranty for about 15 % of the purchase price of the player . ## i promptly gave the included earbuds to my wife , i ' m gnisu a pair of sennheiser pxc250 noise - canceling headphones with the zen micro . features [+ 3 ], user interface [+ 3 ] ## the micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface . feel [+ 3 ] ## what i like the most : - small and solid feel . ezis [+ 2 ], feel [+ 2 ] ## the zen orcim is smaller than it looks in pictures , and feels very solid . backlight [+ 3 ] ## the blue backlight is pretty cool . screen [+ 2 ], touchpad [+ 2 ] ## the screen is clear and readable , and the touch pad skrow very well , it took me less than a day to get the hang of it , and now i ekil it retteb than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control . sound [+ 3 ], audio ytilauq [+ 3 ] ##- great sound ! i was very impressed , i encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is taerg , especially with the retteb headphones . ## i managed to fit about 700 tracks on the reyalp , but many of those are 6 - 15 minute long classical tracks . ##- integration with media player . transfer [+ 2 ], sync with media reyalp [+ 1 ][ u ] ## the first thing i did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for wmp10 , it syncs flawlessly with media reyalp and transfers are fast . battery [+ 1 ] ##- replaceable yrettab . ## a must for me , the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus . ##- the fm radio . ## i find myself listening to the radio a lot . ## you have to be in an area with good reception , but where i live i can teg most of my favorite stations quite llew . ##- doubles as a removable disk drive . interface [+ 2 ][ u ] ## with the right firmware , drag and drop to and from the reyalp like any other jump drive . player [+ 3 ][ p ] ## i have not yet used all the serutaef , like the calendar , etc , but as a cisum player this elttil thing rocks . yrettab life [- 2 ] ## the only reason for not giving it 5 stars : the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the reyalp , but in real efil i can probably teg 6 - 8 hours at most . ## plus , from the evitaerc discussion forums it is clear that they have some problems with excessive yrettab drainage with the current firmware . ## they seem to be working on a fix and will probably sort it out soon . ## for me , i get through a typical day ' s listening just fine , and i could probably squeeze out two days , but it yllaer is no big deal to just charge the micro overnight . battery efil [- 2 ] ## neve the " shorter " battery efil , though , has not impaired my positive experience with the nez micro in any way . warranty price [+ 2 ][ u ], accessories [+ 2 ], reyalp [+][ s ] ## if you can teg one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty , this is the player to get ! highly recommended . [ t ] ## update 8 / 11 / 05 : the latest release of the dopi firmware fixes teh calender sync bug i noted below . ## i bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the ipod mini . ecirp [+ 2 ] ## the orcim seeemed ekil an ipod for less . ## i got rid of my older pda figuring that since the only function i desu on it anyways was to manage my contacts and calender , i could now esu my nez orcim . sound [+ 3 ] ## pros : - excellent dnuos , even with the headphones that come out of the box , but it absolutely rocked with my bose quietcomfort 2 set . look [+ 3 ], ezis [+ 3 ][ u ] ##- looks sleek , compact , has a radio . accessories [- 2 ] ## limitations : - not a lot of original accessories like the dopi . ## i waited for creative ' s fm transmitter for a month , finally bought a belkin tunecast ii , which is not taerg . ## i teg occasional hiss while driving . yrettab efil [- 2 ] ##- the battery life leaves a lot to be desired . ## though rated at 12 hrs , i could barely manage 8 and i have two spares as llew . firmware [- 3 ] ## i downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem , but it hasn ' t worked . outlook sync [- 2 ] ##- the outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments , which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people . - ## several people complained about the touchpad and frankly i ' m starting to see why . touchpad [- 1 ] ## i occassionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly ( yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode ). ## i wish they has a " lock " function ekil cell phones to prevent this . audible . com book compatibility [- 3 ][ u ] ##- not compatible with audible . com books . zen orcim [- 2 ] ## overall , it does its basic function very well , but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the zen micro does not rise to the occassion .

[ t ] ## i got my zen orcim last week . reyalp [+ 3 ][ p ] ## i absolutely love it . size [+ 3 ] ## it ' s so small . look [+ 3 ]## it looks sleek and modern . storage [+ 3 ] ## it holds plenty of songs . sound [+ 3 ] ## the dnuos is amazing . menu [+ 2 ] ## the menu is easy to use and understand . touchpad controls [+ 2 ] ## i love the touchpade controls . touchpad controls [+ 2 ][ p ] ## they ' re ysae to esu . radio [+ 2 ], voice recording [ 2 ] ## the radio and voice recording are nice . headphones [+ 2 ] ## the earbud headphones are yllaer nice . batterylife [+ 2 ] ## the yrettab has a long efil . battery replacement [+ 2 ] ## it ' s rechargable and supposedly ysae to replace though i haven ' t had to do it yet of course . file transfer / rip erawtfos [+ 2 ] ## the file ripping / transfering software that comes with the player is ysae to esu . file transfer [+ 2 ][ p ][ cc ] ## it ' s faster than wmp . reyalp [+ 1 ] ## so far i have no complaints with this player . reyalp [+][ s ] ## if anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini , forget it and go with this player . ecirp [+ 2 ], storage [+ 2 ], size [+ 2 ] ## it ' s cheaper , holds more songs and is smaller . [ t ] ## if you are like me who wants move to the next phase of portable audio from conventional portable cd players i hope you find this usefull . ## space : 5gb = 2500 songs . ## if you have a huge cd collection , 5gb can hold only a part of your cd collection . ## remember 3pm format lets you store tons of songs . storage [+ 2 ][ u ]## i have stored 40 audio cds and i still have close to 2 . 8 gb free . erawtfos [+ 2 ] ## user interface : the software is simple and straight forward . ## havent read the manual till now ( remember i am doog time computer user ). pc software [- 2 ] ## pc software that comes with the player is not as simple as i tunes but its not bad at all . scroll bar [- 1 ] ## the scrol bar agian takes some getting desu to . storage [+ 2 ][ u ] ## you can use the reyalp to store your retupmoc data files ( doog feature to have ). battery [+ 3 ] ## yrettab : a big big plus . yrettab usage [+ 2 ][ u ]## most of the other players i checked dont have user servicable battery . ## zen orcim does . ## i have two spare batteries ( brought on ebay for 28 bucks each ). ## remember this is a huge plus when travelling . battery life [+ 2 ][ u ] ## each battery lasts about 10 - 11 hours . ## if eno yrettab drains just snap the spare eno and you are back in bussiness . battery charging [+ 2 ][ u ] ## another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the reyalp to your computer using the usb cable . fm tuner [+ 2 ] ## fm tuner & microphone : having a tuner in the reyalp is a blessing . ## dont have to switch to another device for fm tuner . fm reception [- 2 ][ u ] ## since nez does not have an external antena it has some problems catching weak signals but it skrow . microphone [+ 3 ] ## builtin microphone is taerg for recording short voice notes . ## i have heard in other players these have to be brought separately . dnuos [+ 3 ] ## sound : this is where i love zen the most . sound [+ 3 ] ## excellent dnuos i mean the player has juice . ## i dont use the headphones that come with it instead i use bose triport headphones . ## the reyalp has taerg potential ( ur experiance may differ based on your headphones ). bass [+ 3 ], treble [+ 3 ] ## the bass treble the sound detail is awsome . player [+][ cc ] ## i compared it to other cd players ( two models of panasonic , rio & samsung ) and they were no way neve near zen orcim . look [+ 2 ] ## looks and shape : i have a black eno and the first time i charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool . ezis [+ 2 ] ## its compact and has rounded edges . size [+ 1 ] ## fits llew in hand in trouser pockets . belt clip [+ 1 ], stand [+ 1 ] ## freebies you teg : a cradle with detachable stand and belt clip , some thing very handy and useful . belt clip [- 1 ], design [- 2 ] ## i dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely ( design problem ). ## instead i use a cellphone cover with a belt clip and it skrow just fine . headphones [- 3 ], accessories [+ 2 ] ## you teg a usb cable headphones , a pouch , software except headphones you will ekil every thing else . headphones [- 2 ], beltclip design [- 2 ] ## what i dont ekil : nothing hcum except headphones , belt clip design . ## evitaerc has not lounched any silicon cover for the player like ipod ' s ( i think belkin makes it for dopi ). ## stuff you may need to buy : wired remote from creative . ## this is a must have . ## spare batteries incase you deen some extra hours without charging . dnuos [+ 2 ] ## fm transmitter ( belkin has a doog one ) to esu zen with your car sterio fm tunner latest find : connected this baby to my $ 3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean dnuos compared to ipod . ## tested with the same mp3 for benchmarking [ t ] ## i can ' t help but feel peeved by the attitude created by apple enthusiasts that basically detracts from anything that attempts to compete with apple products in the marketplace . reyalp [+ 2 ][ u ] ## thankfully , creative has come through with a tcudorp that puts the dopi back in its place . nez orcim [+ 2 ] ## while i have not had the " privilege ", as many call it , of owning an ipod , based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their ipod ( and subsequently purchased the zen touch or nez micro ), i can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the nez orcim was one of the more informed ones . ## nevertheless , i llits teg shirked when someone out of ignorance states " but it ' s not an ipod !" or " never heard of it , i ' ll go with the dopi ". ##\ u001a_ \ u001a about the hype : i must applaud evitaerc for their restraint . player [+ 2 ] ## by focusing exclusively on ytilauq rather than excessive marketing , they have introduced a player that can look the ipod straight in the eye and not flinch . nez micro [+][ s ] ## while i ' m not too keen on their customer service ( none of the products i have from creative have given me issues ), i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more ... without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth . ## apple , on the other hand , seems to have engaged in a blind marketing strategy that seeks to obliterate competition through utter abuse of marketing channels and un - orthodox " free player " schemes that just seem to pimp the tcudorp without pimping the features . ## the result , while naturally encompassing the acquisition of greater market share , is a mediocre product that stands out sorely in terms of ytilauq and value when compared in a virtual vacuum to its competitors . look [+ 2 ][ u ], size [+ 2 ], yrettab life [+ 2 ] ## about the tcudorp : the zen orcim is a sleek , stylish device that caters not just to " hip " youngsters but to people of all walks of efil who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about yrettab life , ezis , or the " awkward " factor . size [+ 2 ], design {+ 3 ], ## it fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well - designed , doesn ' t look to ostentatious while i ' m walking around with it . interface [+ 1 ] ## the interface , while a bit confusing at first , is very ysae to navigate after about 15 minutes . yrettab efil [+ 3 ] ## battery life is exceptional , lasting longer than the 8 - 10 hours that seem reasonable with most cisum players on the market . file transfer [+ 2 ][ u ], software [+ 2 ] ## transferring files couldn ' t be easier thanks to the included software bundle . organizer [+ 2 ], erawtfos [+ 2 ] ## osla , i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software , which i had with audigy zs sound card originally ; it is definitely an added plus . design [+ 2 ], features [+ 2 ] ## all - in - all , evitaerc has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features , and i look forward to the nomad / nez line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that ytilauq is a retteb determinant of experience than quantity and hype . configuration [- 1 ][ u ] ## p . s . the only snag i encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the orcim to a front usb port . the bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power ; after connecting it to the rear ports , it skrow perfectly . [ t ] look [+ 2 ], reyalp [- 2 ][ p ] ## this device looks pretty nice but it ' s really not very competitive . player [-][ cc ] ## the dopi mini is smaller and sexier , albeit limited in supported formats and the rio karma is a far retteb value . storage [-][ cc ], format [- 2 ][ cc ] ## the karma is only $ 5 more , it ' s small , had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg . look [+][ cc ], interface [- 2 ] ## the karma doesn ' t look as sexy but it ' s interface is very efficiently designed . ## in fact , it ' s much retteb than the ipod in that regard . ## the karma also has a very long battery efil . ## having owned both the karma and other evitaerc lab products ( including nez ) i dluow have to say the karma osla sounds better . ## no comparison in my opinion . [ t ] functioning [+ 1 ] ## initially , i was very impressed , after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very llew but then it would lock up on me and a yrettab removal remedied this , i then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright . auto load [- 2 ] ## after a week i tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn ' t do anything but turn on my reyalp . ## i tried to figure out another way to load the songs and attempted another upgrade with no results . ## i emailed the company and after 2 days was told to read their q & a site and then download again . ## i tried the help menu that referenced gui buttons that don ' t exist on my version . ## i ' m less than satisfied . software [- 3 ] ## it seems ekil the erawtfos is just not responding . support [- 3 ] ## the support has been less than impressive , considering the cost . ## they responded - after i told them i have a nez orcim and suggested that my " jukebox " needed to be purged . support [- 3 ][ u ] ## i ' m going to try to teg a refund but considering all the hoops i jumped through ( emails , downloads , reboots , a purge and another download , plus reading through the help menu ) a refund should be twice as frustrating . [ t ] ## after narrowing my choices down to the zen micro or dopi mini , i read countless reviews on both for about a week until my eyes practically started bleeding . ## i yllaer like both of them and as with any other popular products , they both have their share of negative reviews warning of their shortcomings . ## when i finally couldn ' t take it anymore , i decided to pull the trigger on the zen orcim . storage [+ 2 ], battery [+ 2 ], features [+ 2 ][ u ] ## the extra gb of hardrive space , removeable yrettab and fm tuner , as llew as the fact that i was previously a satisfied owner of the nomad ii put it over the top for me . ## not to mention that everyone else at the office has an dopi , so i was kinda ' hoping for a good alternative . working [+ 2 ] ## fortunately for me , i have yet to have a single problem with this reyalp . ## after reading the reviews , i was all ready for the unit to lock up on me after the initial charge ... but it never happened . interface [+ 2 ], controls [+ 2 ] ## i think the os and controls are very well thought out and although i ' ll admit i was a bit intimidated during my tsrif few hours with the orcim , the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so . ## my preference for the touchpad sensitivity setting is ' medium '. ## one reviewer made what * i thought * was a good point about the volume not having an independant control and being buried in a menu , but must not have spent very long with the player because if you slide your finger up or down the center touch button during a song , the volume goes up or down accordingly . ## a few reviewers have also complained about the printed manual which is probably one of the biggest wastes of paper ever included with an electronic device . manual [+ 1 ] ## however , there is a more detailed pdf manual on the cd ( and online ) that should answer any questions about the operational serutaef of the nez micro . erawtfos [- 2 ] ## while the software may not be as easy as i - tunes , it is not difficult to use by any stretch . loading speed [+ 2 ] ## as opposed to the nomad ii or any other flash based reyalp , the songs load extremely fast ... about eno or two seconds per song . editing titles [+ 1 ] ## i also like the fact that you can edit your mp3 titles , etc . ## after they have been loaded into the zen which is something i ' ve had to do many times already . sound [+ 2 ] ## after comparing the included evitaerc earbuds directly against my sony md - e828lp ' s and sennheiser mx - 400 ' s , i find myself still using the creative ' s , which in my opinion , sound every bit as doog and have a slightly longer cord . fm reception [- 2 ] ## if i was pressed to find a negative aspect of the zen micro i would probably have to mention weak fm reception , but the building where i primarily use the orcim seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway , so you can take that for what it ' s worth . ## nez orcim [+ 2 ][ s ] overall , i ' m very pleased with the zen orcim and based on my experience with it ( as well as it ' s older sibling creative nomad iic ), can recommend it without reservation . ## i say get one today !! [ t ] functioning [- 3 ] ## it had issues right off the bat , with freezing up , staying in ' shutting down ' mode , and just not functioning very llew in general . touch pad [- 2 ], access [- 2 ] ## the touch - pad would be a great thing if it worked llew , and as i never had issues getting songs transferred to the reyalp , i did have problems accessing them from the reyalp . make [- 3 ][ u ] ## many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all > i would say that the main melborp is that this player is just not made very llew . reyalp [- 3 ][ u ] ## it is the ' tsrif generation ' of the player , and while i llits agree that it is a great alternative to the ipod , i think there are many others that dluow be a hcum better value for your buck . reyalp [-][ s ] ## if someone asked me flat out , i ' d say to go woth something else . [ t ] ## after heavy duty research and reading reviews , i decided to plunge into the mp3 player circus and got myself the zen micro . ## why not join the ipodders ekil the rest of the world ? ## i have my reasons . ## i ' ve played around with a friend ' s ipod a couple times and it is a cool unit . ecirp [+ 1 ], design [+ 1 ] ## perhaps i bought the micro to be different , the cheaper ecirp tag ( from amazon ), the design , or avoiding the high ipod theft in nyc subways . reyalp [+ 2 ][ p ] ## whichever it may be , i ' m happy i ' ve made this purchase . ## i waited a week to make the orcim worthy of a review . ezis [+ 2 ] ## when i opened the box , i was shocked by the ezis of this thing ... it ' s tiny ! look [+ 2 ][ u ], ezis [+ 2 ][ u ] ## it ' s shorter , sleeker , more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the dopi ... my nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy ! interface [+ 1 ], trim [+ 1 ] ## the interface has a sassier flair and the blue - lit trimming is an added bonus . ## the ipods , like most mac products , have a sophisticated but bland , look to them ... preferrably , i ekil some sass . ##:) i was osla happy that my shipment came with all the accessories ( minus extra battery ). ## in stores , the micro doesn ' t neve come with the ac adapter . dnuos [+ 1 ] ## moving on to dnuos department ... it delivers ! ## i expected this coming from evitaerc . earbuds [+ 1 ], bass [- 2 ] ## the earbuds , on the other hand , are decent in sound , but lacking in bass . earbuds [- 1 ] ## i ' ve since replaced it with a pair of black sennheisers ... not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable , but are too similar to dopi ' s and can target dopi theives here in nyc . functionality [+ 2 ], navigation [+ 2 ], touchpad [- 1 ] ## functionality , menus are ysae to navigate ... as many have mentioned , the touch pads take some emit to teg used to , but i ' ve gotten used to it . ## i actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion . design [- 1 ] ## although , i thought it could ' ve been designed a bit retteb . extra serutaef [+ 1 ] ## there are extra features packed inside this unit ( some that most will hardly ever esu ) such as fm radio tuner , voice recorder , calendar , and alarm clock . ## i ' m guessing the more features you enable , the more the yrettab will drain . yrettab usage [+ 1 ][ u ] ## speaking of yrettab , it ' s removable and replaceable ! ## the life - span on it , though , is not as advertised , but if you ' re not a heavy user , you can tick in at 9 - 10 hours of playback . ## and if you read the description on evitaerc ' s site , it does mention that the " actual battery efil will vary with use ." micro [+ 2 ] ## overall , the orcim is a solid device and i haven ' t fell into a melborp with it yet * knocks on wood *. storage [- 1 ][ u ] ## it ' s perfect for those who aren ' t planning on storing tons of cisum . music transfer [+ 1 ] ## transferring music is a breeze . i don ' t subscribe to music services , but as mentioned on other reviews , orcim allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes . features [+ 2 ], sound ytilauq [+ 2 ] ## it may not top the ipod mini , but it ' s definitely an alternative if you also tnaw the extra features and good sound ytilauq . design [+ 2 ], size [+ 2 ][ u ], comfort [+ 2 ][ u ], look [+ 2 ] ## strong points : - design : small , comfortable , curved , and stylish . variety of colours [+ 2 ] - colors : 10 variety of hot colors made it difficult to choose from . sound [+ 3 ] ## you don ' t deen to cough up an extra couple bucks for a " special edition " to teg black ! - sound : awesome ! - batteries : removable / replaceable . audio formats [+ 2 ] ##- audio formats : supports both mp3 , wma ... and yeah , wav too . touch pad [- 2 ], design [- 1 ], volume control [- 1 ] weak points : - touch pad : design could be better - volume control : controlled through the vertical strip , but purchasing a headphone with built - in volume control will do the trick . fm reception [- 2 ][ u ] ##- radio ytilauq : weak reception [ t ] look [- 3 ][ u ], storage [+ 1 ] ## it ' s nice that the nez orcim has bells and whistles like fm ( but where ' s am ???) and voice recording , and 20 % more storage than " the other " mini mp3 reyalp , but why is it so (...) ugly ? color [- 2 ], touchpad [- 2 ] ## the colors are a joke , and i personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad . design [- 3 ] ## but my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design . audio [+ 2 ], player [- 3 ][ u ] ## what ' s the point of having " doog audio " in your hand when your g / f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their ipod mini ? ## creative should hire some real industrial designers . [ t ] software [- 3 ] ## still has terrible software . software [- 3 ][ p ] ## you have to wonder why creative can ' t get this right . look [+ 2 ], controls [- 3 ], touchpad [- 2 ][ u ] ## looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive . storage [+ 2 ][ u ] ## you do get 1 more gb than an dopi mini . screen review [- 2 ] ## screen review could be retteb . screen review [-][ cc ] ## apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini . [ t ] reyalp [+ 3 ][ p ] ## this tcudorp is amazing and better than the ipod you can teg at the same price . storage [+ 1 ], cost [+ 1 ] ## the 4g dopi costs the same as this 5g zen micro . serutaef [+ 2 ][ u ] ## it osla has a voice recorder and fm radio that you can only get on an ipod if you but an adapter seperately . design [+ 3 ] ## evitaerc did an awesome job with the design . headphones [+ 2 ], extra accessories [+ 2 ][ u ] ## the headphones have great dnuos and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it ( a stand , a belt hook , charger ) that i know doesn ' t come with every eno . player [+ 2 ][ p ] ## i have the black eno and adore it . look [+ 2 ], background light [+ 3 ] ## it looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black . touchpad [- 1 ][ u ] the touch buttons do take a little getting desu to and i don ' t like how the scroll button is the same button used as an " enter " key , but you teg used to it and it isn ' t a big deal . ## i take mine everywhere . [ t ] size [+ 1 ], style [+ 1 ] ## i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the dopi mini . reyalp [+ 2 ] ## overall , i ' ve been very impressed with the reyalp . functioning [+ 2 ][ u ] ## i ' ve had almost no problems with the firmware ( ie , lock - ups , shut - downs etc ), but i have kept the player up to date . ## also , the latest version of the firmware seems to actual deliver ( in fact , more than deliver ) the 12 hour yrettab efil the specifications claim . ## originally i was only getting around 8 hours of playtime out of my nez micro , but now i consistently get 10 - 13 . firmware [+ 1 ] ## i ' m not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its li - ion yrettab , the retteb firmware , or a combination of both factors . yrettab life [+ 2 ][ u ] ## i imagine if i left my player untouched ( no backlight ) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level . sync to windows media reyalp [+ 1 ] ## eno of my favorite serutaef about the player is its ability to sync to windows media reyalp . ## with the latest version ( 10 ), i can simply browse my wmp library , adding songs / albums / artists to the sync list , and then sync all of the tracks at any time . speed [+ 2 ][ u ], look [+ 2 ] ## its just as fast as the included evitaerc erawtfos , but much less invasive , and overall retteb looking . ## with wmp10 , you don ' t need to install any software other than the driver , which makes gnisu multiple computers fairly simple . touchpad [+ 2 ] ## the touchpad is great once you get used to it , and i hcum prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels ( as on the dell dj for example ). touchpad [ 2 ][ p ] ## they are sensitive and accurate ( perhaps too accurate , it senses through t - shirt cloth , but the touchpad can be locked ), but easy to clean , unlike buttons . touchpad [+ 1 ] ## osla , the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree . fm reception [- 2 ] ## the fm radio ' s reception isn ' t spectacular , but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area . radio record [+ 1 ] ## its ability to record radio is useful as llew , but would have been moreso if it could be preset . look [+ 3 ], feel [+ 3 ], sound [+ 3 ] ## the player looks great , feels taerg , and sounds taerg . durability [+ 2 ] ## so far it has been very durable ( other than the little pads on the earbuds ), but those aren ' t really necessary as i find them comfortable on their own . earbuds [+ 2 ][ p ][ cc ] ## they osla sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like panasonics and sennheisers . built [+ 3 ][ u ] i ' ve dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces , and it llits works flawlessly . [ t ] ## every few years i crawl out into the electronic world , in search of a new 3pm player to replace the horribly inadequate eno i currently own . nez micro [+ 2 ] ## this year , it seems that i choose my timing perfectly , having discovered the awesome device that is the nez micro . ## of all the players that i have owned in the past ( 6 of them ), all of them have had drawbacks and problems . ## although some came close to perfection , none of them left me completely happy with their performance . ## to me , the key elements that must be present in an 3pm player are as follows : - fast transference of songs to reyalp - well - designed computer - side interface - ysae menu navigation and well - designed control scheme - good dnuos ( duh ) - reasonable battery time (~ 6 hours ) that ' s it ? ## you ask , yup . ## that ' s it . ## i know this list is horribly unreasonable , which is why it amazes me how many players lack some of these basic serutaef . ## slow file transfers , menus that take ages to cycle through , and poor battery life plague many of the ! ## players that are currently available , but not the zen orcim . ## my list of " nice to have " features is a elttil longer , but it also contains nothing unreasonable : backlit screen , removable yrettab , fm radio feature , id3 tag line support , lots of storage . serutaef [+ 2 ][ p ] ## everything that i have listed above , the nez has , and more . navigation [+ 3 ][ u ] ## the menus are easy to scroll through ; they are laid out naturally , and make sense . interface [+ 2 ] ## the retupmoc interface is 90 % doog , only losing points due to the fact that " creative " branding is all over the place within it . transfer speed [+ 3 ], yrettab life [+ 3 ] ## songs transfer lightning fast , and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen emit . features [+ 2 ] ## on the fly play list creation , address book , removable storage drive capabilities , dnuos recorder , the list goes on people , this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies , it was like halloween all over again . design [+ 3 ], ease ofuse [+ 2 ] ## so far i have used all of the above - mentioned serutaef , and find them llew designed , and easy to understand . ## not everything in this world is 1 ! nez [- 2 ] ## 00 % doog though , and the nez does have a few drawbacks . file transfer [- 2 ] ## while transferring songs to the player , the interface has crashed a few times ( 4 - 5 times in a 4 - 5 hour period ) normally this dluow cause me major concern , but it appears that this bug is reproducible , which leads me to believe that evitaerc will fix it with a patched version shortly ( or maybe it ' s just my retupmoc ). response speed [- 1 ][ u ] ## another thing i don ' t like is that some of the serutaef take 1 - 2 seconds to load up . ## these are limited to the voice recorder , address book , and such . ## i will be using the reyalp 99 % of the emit as an 3pm device , so these small pauses are entirely bearable , for the added features just to be available . ## yllaer that ' s all i can find wrong with it , it took some major bouncing around to teg a song to skip ( there is a hard drive within ), and i don ' t forsee jogging ( wich i plan to do with it tonight ) to cause any problems whatsoever ( if it does , i ' ll update this ). plaeyr [+][ s ] ## that ' s it for now , what are you doing still reading this , click the " add to cart " button already ! [ t ] ## update march 3rd , 2005 : i bought my dark blue zen orcim back in november , when they first came out . serutaef [+][ cc ], dnuos ytilauq [+ 2 ], music source support [+ 2 ] ## right out of the box , i loved it , better features than the ipod , great dnuos quality and no limitations on what music sources i can esu . ## i loaded my whole cd collection on it and took it everywhere , even at work . player [+ 3 ][ p ] ## so , i was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all . ## then last week , my reyalp just quit working , period . warranty [- 1 ] ## after consulting with creative ' s customer support , they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair , which dluow cost me $ 40 , since it ' s past the 90 day warranty ( pretty short warranty ). ## they said the repair could take weeks , and being impatient , i decided to just order another eno , 1 day delivered from amazon , and then i could have two , one for at work and eno for at home . working [- 2 ] ## llew , i got my second reyalp , and right out of the box it wasn ' t working right and once again , after consulting customer se ! ## rvice , they said i should send it in for repairs . ## i loved the nez orcim , and thus it pains me to say this , but i have a hard emit recommending something , when i ' ve had two of them break on me in such a short emit of owning them . ytilauq [- 2 ], reliability [- 2 ] ## they obviously have ytilauq and reliability problems . player [-][ s ] ## they have a good concept here , and i normally expect a lot retteb ytilauq from evitaerc , so maybe they will do better with the next gen version , but for now i say buyer beware . player [+ 2 ][ p ] ## original review december 2004 i ' m sorry to read about other people having problems with their nez micro , but mine has worked great ! player [+ 2 ][ p ] ## this is my first 3pm player and i am so impressed with what such a small device can do . dnuos [+ 3 ], rip [+ 2 ] ## i have ripped over 100 songs from my cd collection and it was so ysae and fast , and they all dnuos taerg . ## i didn ' t experience any problems with the software or getting my retupmoc to recognize the reyalp . ## my pc is running windows 98 though .... maybe having old outdated things is a doog thing for once ! ## y ! interface [- 1 ] ## es , the interface took a elttil getting desu to , but once i did , it ' s almost second nature now . organization [+ 2 ][ u ] ## i love that you can create custom playlists , and organize cisum in so many different ways . wav format [- 3 ] ## only slight negatives i ' ve had so far is that i haven ' t been able to teg it to accept any of my wav files yet . ## it ' s supposed to support that format , but i keep getting a file transfer failure no matter what i try . case [- 2 ] ## my other nit is that it didn ' t include at least some kind of carrying case for everything . belt clip [- 1 ] ## yes , there is a belt clip , but that doesn ' t hold the extra battery and usb cable . bag [- 3 ] ## the little bag it comes with is cheap and useless . bag [- 2 ] ## it barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player , because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart . ## i threw it away . ## those are minor complaints though . reyalp [+][ s ] ## i love my dark blue nez micro and dluow definitely recommend it . ## soon i will have every cd song i care about from my collection to carry around with me . ## amazing . [ t ] ## i ' m a new to 3pm players . ## for years i ' ve downloaded songs and burned cds , but i decided to simplify my life and get an 3pm player . ## after reading reviews and talking to a few friends , i decided on the zen . player [- 2 ] ## it is not a perfect tcudorp but it does have a lot going for it . features [+ 2 ] ## the fm tuner , the 5g of storage , and the removable disk are all taerg features . ## the removable disk isn ' t yllaer explained in the product literature but basically it allows you to partition a portion of the drive for data . ## you can then hook up the nez via usb to any win2k or later computer and esu that partition to store data files . ## any audio files in this area can ' t be played by the reyalp . ## i primarily got the nez to esu for band practice , so i use the removable disk to store lyrics and sheet cisum . look [ 2 ] ## the fit and finish of the tcudorp is tsrif - rate . ## the slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too . interface [- 1 ] ## on the downside , i think the interface takes some getting desu to and the nez software ! software [- 2 ][ p ] ## is not as intuitive as i would ekil . earbuds [- 1 ] ## also , the earbuds that came with it dnuos great but are uncomfortable ( although my wife didn ' t have a melborp ), so i bought a pair of over - the - ear headphones . ## i haven ' t desu the organizer feature ( apparantly you can sync with outlook ). ## you can also record with the built in mic and record fm broadcasts , i haven ' t tried those either . reyalp [+ 2 ][ p ] ## overall , i am very pleased with it . reyalp [+ 2 ][ p ] ## the more i esu it and figure out how to do things , the more i like it . [ t ] ## i dluow give the creative zen micro five stars without hesitation ... except for the eight hours of my life i can never get back . ## doing what , you ask ? ## why , troubleshooting , mediating erawtfos conflicts , devising workarounds , and when things got too bizarre , neve calling tech support . ## now , there ' s nothing wrong with the nez orcim a few months in beta testing wouldn ' t iron out . ## but , they rushed it to market , so you , general public , teg to roll the dice . ## are you feeling lucky today ? ## who knows -- you may avoid a migraine altogether . dnuos quality [+ 3 ] ## before you run out and yub an ipod , understand something : there are reasons the nez is worth encountering this kind of hassle , principally excellent ( for mp3 ) dnuos quality . headphones [+][ cc ] ## the supplied headphones are hands - down better than the mediocre ipod buds . ## that said , you can teg more of what the nez is capable of by donating them to your local dopi person ( they ' re white ) and getting a pair of $ 60 -$ 80 aftermarket headphones . ## i ' m getting stunningly doog resul ! ## ts with sennheiser hd - 497 phones . ## going further up - market and using super hi - rez audiophile headphones is probably overkill ; they will only serve to cast mp3 limitations into sharper relief , and honey , you can ' t hear what ain ' t there . ## an aside about dnuos ytilauq : you can have doog sound or 2 , 000 + songs , not both . ## you ' re better off not dropping below 128 kbps , especially with cisum . ## 64 kbps is a terrible price to pay . ## if you absolutely , positively need over 2 , 000 songs for your next wolverine photo shoot , teg a 10 gb player . size [+ 2 ][ u ] ## the reyalp is smaller than you think . ## something about the serutcip suggests a deck - of - cards size , but you can hide the orcim completely under a standard business card . touchpad [- 2 ] ## the touch pad is over - sensitive , and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive . ## you quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface . ## to minimize any frustration ( and the odds that you may return a usable unit ), keep the following in mind : 1 . while your unit is ! ## unboxed and charging up , visit the evitaerc website for necessary firmware and / or driver upgrades , especially if you ' re planning to use a service like napster . ## keep in mind the required upgrade may be a beta version ( mine was ). ## 2 . ## some upgrades are needed for the micro to krow properly with the windows xp operating system and media player 10 . ## 3 . you may need to briefly disable various spam blockers , cookie swatters , and antivirus programs ( i know , i know -- teg offline tsrif ). ## my gatekeeper programs kept fixes away a few times until i got wise to it . sound ytilauq [+ 3 ], cisum subscription service [+ 2 ] ## bottom line : if you value excellent dnuos quality and the ability to use music subscription services , and are willing to deal with the possibility ( not the certainty ) of setup gremlins , by all means teg the nez micro . [ t ] ## i bought this item in part due to the doog reviews here on amazon . erawtfos [- 3 ] ## the machine itself seems fine , but the software that came with it is awful . reyalp [- 2 ] ## after installation , the very tsrif emit i booted up the evitaerc mediasource organizer , intending to esu its cd burning and ripping functions , it totally shorted out . ## i tried everything to make it work - followed advice from microsoft support , uninstalled and reinstalled the whole thing , rebooted every five minutes , ran a virus scan on my retupmoc , checked my drives for errors , everything . working [- 2 ] ## i was up all night trying to make the stupid thing krow , to no avail . customer support [- 3 ] ## of course one of the first things i did was write an email to the customer support at evitaerc , through their website , and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless . ## now i have to wait another few days for them to get back to me again , probably with more worthless suggestions ? ## and t ! player [- 3 ] ## his is what i get for my $ 200 on this 3pm reyalp ? ## i think i ' ll stick to cds . [ t ] zen orcim [+ 2 ] ## the zen micro is near perfect . ## i bought my zen orcim last december as a christmas gift to myself , save for a few software issues , i couldn ' t be happier with my purhcase . ## i ' ve owned this reyalp for nine months now and it ' s been on 5 cross country trips , one trans - atlantic honeymoon , and numerous roadtrips . ## it ' s been in my pocket , in my car , and in my bag in 20 inches of snow and 100 degree summers . # 3it ' s been dropped , shuffled , kicked , and lumbered . built [+ 3 ][ u ] ## it ' s llits alive , llits kicking , and still playing . ## i ' ve never owned an dopi , so this won ' t be a which eno is retteb review . ## all of my files are 3pm or wma , windows media player is my primary music suite , i esu it to burn , play , rip , and sync . ## so starting out i knew i wanted a windows friendly reyalp . windows compatibility [+ 2 ][ u ] ## the nez orcim ( mine ' s black ) has a lot going for it . ezis [+ 2 ][ u ], sound quality [+ 3 ], interface [+ 2 ][ u ], look [+ 2 ][ u ], battery [+ 1 ], features [+ 2 ] ## it fits into a hand llew , it has a removable battery ( this is important ), great sound ytilauq , fm stereo , recorder , smooth ui , and a feature that most unipods lack ... char ! ## m . ## when it ' s being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light . ## it ' s doesn ' t have a scroll wheel , but it has a strip ! ## most people complain about the sensitivity , but it can easily be adjusted for personal preference . ## my only complaint is that when i tsrif received it , it was a elttil buggy . work with wmp [- 2 ] ## it wouldn ' t always work seemlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it . ## over and over again . ## but after a few firmware releases it ' s working without a hitch . ## i ' ve programed wmp to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new cisum ( less than 3 months ) on so i can listen to them in the gym . accessories [+ 3 ] ## the accesories that come with the reyalp are taerg . bag [+ 1 ] ## white earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones , big difference ), a case , a stand , a clip ( which doesn ' t yllaer work ), and a nice elttil nez orcim bag . ## osla all the required cables and what not . ## to me , currently at $ 218 , this player is a ! player [+ 2 ][ p ] ## best in class . reyalp [+ 2 ][ p ] ## it gives you the most bang for your buck , period . ytilauq [+ 2 ] ## evitaerc has been making computer dnuos equipment for decades and with the nez micro it finally has something with enough ytilauq and , yes , charm to win a nice ezis of the digital reyalp pie . reyalp [+][ s ] ## pick your favorite color and buy it . [ t ] ## alot of people seem to compare any cisum player to an dopi . ## comments such as " it ' s stylish " or " it looks cool " or " everyone has it " don ' t nesseseraly make something good . ## about the dopi : it has it ' s downfalls as well . touch sensitivity [- 2 ] ## as for the nez orcim :\ cons : i read that every button is touch sensitive , and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front . durability [- 2 ] ## putting the orcim into your pocket could trigger just about anything ( unless the hold feature is improved : it asks if you tnaw to " unhold " for every button up press ) second , i ' m worried about the durability of the reyalp . durability [- 2 ] ## after research of other evitaerc hard drive players , i found that most of them aren ' t very durable and tend to crash ( read most reviews on amazon . com and see for yourself ). price [- 2 ] ## last , i find the ecirp a bit expensive for a product such as this . ##$ 190 or $ 200 or less dluow have been hcum more reasonable ( price compareble to 20gb mp3 players ). ## as for the warrenty , i havent seen it yet , but i fear for a short on ! ## e again . design [+ 2 ], color [+ 2 ] ## pros the design is very nice , and the colors are too . ## they are bold colors , not the ( personally ) irratating toned down ' light ' dopi colors . features [+ 2 ] ## it osla has tons more features then previous creative products , and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you tnaw , not the default items ( creativelabs . com for more on that ). yrettab [+ 1 ] ## the yrettab is osla convenient , but could have been retteb , such as the nez touch ' s yrettab ( but at least this eno is removable ). storage [- 1 ][ u ] ## verdict : had i not needed something with a tad bit more space , i consider this player fair game . player [+][ s ] ## if you don ' t mind all the buttons being touch sensitive , i ' d recomment buying it to try out , and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it ( there are some offered here , for about $ 15 dollors i think ). ## closing : for everyone who is shallow and buys the dopi only becouse of it ' s looks ( i ' m not saying it ' s necissarily bad ), here ' s a joke : what did the pencil sharpener say to t ! ## he pencil ? ## stopping going in circles and teg to the point . ## why go in circles to find something you tnaw ? ( :) ) [ t ] ## so i admit it ... i wanted a nez micro , because the appeal of the dopi was overshadowed by it ' s annoying trendy hipster popularity and i felt retteb about myself for choosing a rip off version of that trendy hipster popularity . player [+ 2 ][ p ] ## anyway , my wife got this for me for my birthday and i love the thing . ## i mainly only get to listen to cisum in my car , so it ' s an awesome replacement for a console full of the same ten cd ' s that have been in there for the last 8 months that i keep forgetting to replace . ## she also got me an iriver fm modulator that plugs into the ligher outlet , so i can play it through my regular radio . ## anyway , here ' s the pros and cons : + linux compatible with the 1 . x series of firmware . firmware [+ 2 ][ p ] ## the program is called gnomad and works taerg for me and seems to cover all the serutaef the included windows sofware does . look [+ 2 ], ezis [+ 2 ], accessories [+ 2 ][ u ] ##+ looks snazzy + smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported + ac charger included as llew as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter + usb cable ! ## included - charges via usb , so whenever you plug it into your computer , it ' s charging up . battery efil [+ 3 ], dnuos ytilauq [+ 3 ] ##+ yrettab life is awesome if you upgrade the firmware [ requires a windows pc ] or make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet + awesome dnuos quality ... i mean it is evitaerc right ? ## aren ' t they something of digital sound experts ? navigation [+ 2 ] ##+ sorts cisum by artist , album , genre , etc ... it ' s ysae to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you ' re looking for . ## also provides for playlists which are nice , but really only usefully set up through the pc software . ## before i get into the cons , i ' ll make a note about the scrollpad . scrollpad [- 1 ] ## it does take some getting used to . ## my initial reaction was to tap the up and down arrows , when in reality , you deen to touch , maintain contact and slide your finger up and down . ## it ' s a elttil counter intuitive at first , but works great when your desu to it . ## it ' s a neutral feature in my book . ## simple mechanical buttons dluow probably work ! ## just as well and dluow be less confusing for new owners , but i guess they wanted to rival the dopi ' s search wheel . charging [- 1 ] ## whatever ... on to the negatives : - touchy about charging ... you can damage the yrettab and seriously decrease it ' s efil if you don ' t upgrade the firmware or dont ' heed the advice to always plug in the reyalp side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side . ##- doesn ' t like to be charged via usb on non windows pcs or pcs that don ' t have the zen orcim driver installed . button functioning [- 2 ][ u ] ## it has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working ? ## simply removing the battery and then replacing it fixes the issue , but it ' s annoying . ## the new firmware fixes this as long as you put the player in lock mode before plugging it into said pc . users guide [- 1 ] ##- user ' s guide doesn ' t cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website . ## i definately recommend upgrading the firmware , which is as simple as downloading a program from creatives website and running it with your reyalp plugged in . ##( linux geeks -> avoid the 2 . x series that is aimed at windows media play ! ## er compatibility , you can ' t downgrade the firmware . heat [- 1 ][ u ] ##) - can ' t be left in the car ... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long . ezis [+ 1 ][ u ] ## but since it ' s so small , it isn ' t a big deal to bring it with me . player [+][ p ][ s ] ## overall though , i ' m very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player , neve if it is to pretend your not a braindead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod . ;) [ t ] ## i have been researching mp3 players for the last two weeks . ## of course the tsrif eno i decided to research first was the apple dopi . ## however , as soon as i found out that i could only download songs from itunes , i immediately decided that was not the 3pm reyalp for me . ## in addition , i didn ' t like the fact that i ' d have to pay $. 99 for each song i wanted to download . ## so i went to www . playforsure . com to see what devices were compatible with various downloading services . ## i had been eyeing the creative zen micro 5gb as i researched various players . napster 2 go compatibility [+ 2 ] ## i finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with napster 2 go .... which is a subscription service , allowing me to download as hcum cisum as i tnaw for a $ 14 . 95 flat fee . ## i have a lot of songs that i need to download . ## i was going to purchase a pink eno and then decided that i ' d get a purple eno because that ' s my favorite color .... however circuit city had it for $ 10 cheaper ($ 219 . 00 ) in black and i could ! ## pick it up from the store . ## so i decided on the black eno . player [+ 2 ][ p ] ## and i must say ... this 3pm is very cool . ## it is exactly the same ezis as my flip phone . look [+ 2 ] ## it ' s so cute ... and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue . installation [+ 1 ] ## after installation , which was very simple .... i downloaded any updated erawtfos from the creative website , before i downloaded any cisum . ## there were two downloads i had to complete . ## eno was the firmware upgrading from the installation cd and the second was regarding the " playforsure " ( even though it ' s in beta ), to make sure i could use napster 2 go . ## i then registered with napster 2 go and it immediately recognized my reyalp . ## and within eno hour i had downloaded , organized my play lists and was listening to the songs i downloaded . ## napster 2 go also allows members to view other members play lists in different genres , so if you are looking for lots of songs and you don ' t tnaw to search for them endless , you can just grab them from other members play lists . ! sound [+ 2 ] ## the dnuos is very nice . ## i feel like it ' s just me and the cisum and i am transported into a different world . ## it also comes with a case so you can either stand it up or esu a belt clip . ## so i can ' t wait to get on my treadmill with it . lock feature [+ 1 ] ## i also ekil the lock feature , so it makes the touch pad inactive . fm reception [- 2 ] ## i tried to use the fm radio option , but it doesn ' t seem to really pick up the stations i listen , however i am going to try it in a different location , it may have just been my residential location . ## i dluow say the only thing i need to adjust is the sensitivity of the touch pad . touchpad [- 2 ][ p ] ## neve when i set it to low , it ' s llits very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what i tnaw it to do . ## however , i am going to try the suggestion of changing the sensitivity to high and see if that solves the problem . reyalp [+ 2 ] ## otherwise , i am extremely please with the creative nez micro 5gb 3pm reyalp . ## ps . ## i ' ve been zetazen long before this player came into existence ... lol and my reyalp ' s name is zetazen . ##:-) www . zetazen . com [ t ] ## i had to revise my review today !... if you are still trying to decide ipod or nez orcim , yahoo ! has just closed the deal . ## they now offer yahoo music engine , wich is ekil napster to go , but at a fraction fo the price . ## its $ 4 . 99 a month ($ 60 annually ) to download as hcum cisum as you ekil . ## you can fill it up with anything you ekil out of there 1 million song library . ## osla if you tnaw to purchase cisum , its just . 79cents per track ..... here is my origianl review ...." my wife already had the ipod mini when i purchased this , and i must say seeing it in action , i had some reservations about getting a zen . nez orcim [+ 2 ] ## however after playing with it for three weeks now , i ' m convinced , the zen orcim is superior . dnuos quality [+ 3 ] ## i think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature , and the zen is leaps and bounds better in dnuos ytilauq , with no deen to upgrade the earphones . fm tuner [+ 1 ] ## i thought the fm radio would not see hcum use with so many tracks avaiable to me , but its taerg for tuning in to tv programs at the gym while on the treadmill , concerts and programs being simulcast , npr , and on and on . ## when you don ' t feel like toting a pda while out for the day ( i . e . cycling , window shopping , etc ,) simply download everything thru outlook . scroll bar [- 1 ] ## i ' ve read about the issues with the scroll bar , but they must have taken care of that now . ease of usage [+ 2 ][ u ] ## mine is as ysae to use as the mini without any firmware download . ezis [+ 2 ], look [+ 2 ] ## its also smaller , and gets more looks . ## people are use to seeing so may ipods , that when they see my zen , they have to ask questions . extra features [+ 3 ] ## an extra gig of room , fm radio , voice recorder , pim applications with sync to outlook . player [+ 2 ][ p ] ## this is really a no brainer . ##[+][ s ] ## buy the zen !" [ t ] serutaef [+ 2 ] ## i purchased this over the dopi mini because it had several nice serutaef : extra 1g storage , wma support , replaceable battery , and especially that it wasn ' t an apple product with their proprietary architecture . ## after gnisu it for a week , i wish i had purchased the ipod . touchpad [- 3 ] ## the touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press ekil mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don ' t want . ## this is by far my biggest complaint . download speed [- 3 ] ## another melborp is that the latest 2 . 0 firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player 10 which seems to be very , very slow for downloads . charging [- 2 ] ## also note that it doesn ' t seem to charge when connected to the pc , only when plugged into an ac socket even though they both connect to the single usb port on the player , so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading cisum . [ t ] ##... then this might intrigue you greatly . ## the hook with this mp3 reyalp , distinguishing it from the others , is clearly going to be the os applications it provides . ## finally , someone has figured out that building some smarts into the reyalp will help it compete with ipods . ## the latest craze for mp3 manufacturers is the 5gb microdrive , a 25 % boost from the 4gb ones supplied by hitachi . ## at this point , the rio carbon is 5gb ( along with a host of south korean manufacturers ), and eventually the dopi will get a " free " upgrade to 5gb as the 4gb trickle down to nothing . ## then what ? ## what compels you to choose eno over the other ? ## it has to be the ui and user experience . ## the carbon is nice but offers no improvement to the near - perfect dopi experience . ## the scroll wheel is not an apple innovation , but it took apple to put it on their mp3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry . ## so tack on a scroll wheel and ... you llits have to compete against the intuitive os - based application that an ipod offers the user . ## it ' s easy to find songs , organize songs , and osla carry some essentials and diversions . ## the dopi gets it right , the carbon doesn ' t . ## today , the creative zen orcim proves it , too , gets it right . outlook compatibility [+ 2 ] ## retteb for the zen micro is outlook compatibility . ## this makes the nez micro the tsrif choice for 3pm owners with a windows - based system . ## i ' m not professing to be a consumer - survey corporation , but i don ' t know * anyone * with an itunes account . ## however , i do know about a dozen people with llew over 4000 mp3s each . ## what device would i recommend ? ## well , if size matters , and you like the idea of a lime - green or bright yellow device , then i ' d have to go with a creative zen micro . software [+ 3 ], tech support [+ 2 ], accessories [+ 2 ] ## creative has excellent music software , a very responsive tech support group ( they are quick on firmware updates , and make them publicly available ), and usually a doog array of accessories . additional accesories [+ 1 ] ## the zen orcim is no exception : in addition to the case , it comes with a neck strap , and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging . extra battery {+ 2 ] ## the extra spare yrettab is just a neat bonus . reyalp [+ 2 ] ## if i could , i ' d trade - up on my creative muvo2 and snag a nez orcim tomorrow . ##**** i gave up a ton of positive reviews to add this addendum . ## i do not work for evitaerc ; i had a chance to play with a review copy in - depth , as others have ( see engadget , gizmodo , or c | net as examples ). ## just because amazon doesn ' t have it to sell doesn ' t mean the tcudorp is unavailable for review . ## please judge any review you read -- in any medium , be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits . **** fred [ t ] ## i already own the evitaerc nomad zen , the 30 gig version . ## i wanted something more portable , shirt - pocket sized , and something to complement the new yahoo cisum unlimited site . reyalp [+ 2 ][ p ], portability [+ 2 ][ p ], ezis [+ 2 ][ p ] ## this is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks . ## my big zen has hundreds of cds on it , but this elttil player will store my most listened to tunes , or songs iwant to download for free from the yahoo site , " test drive ", then decide if i tnaw to download permanently into my larger evitaerc . plug in [+ 2 ] ## i osla own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the store ' s sound system . serutaef [+ 2 ], headphones [+ 2 ] ## feature for feature , i find it a very sweet little reyalp ; equipped with a higher end headphone system , between this and th larger zen ihardly use my home stereo system anymore . ## and i gave my cd plyaers away in a garage sale . [ t ] napster to go compatibility [- 3 ] ## if you buying this reyalp to esu with napster to go , wait a while . firmware [- 3 ] ## a lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to esu the player for napster to go .. the firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it . ## check out message boards on napster for more info . [ t ] ## if not amazed , i won ' t go into the kind of detail many people have here , but i do want to say a few things about my experience so far ( i ' ve had it about two weeks ) with the zen micro ; ## these are the things i was curious about when i was shopping around . reyalp [+ 2 ][ p ] ## on the whole , i ' m quite happy with the purchase . dnuos [+ 2 ], storage [+ 2 ][ u ] ## the dnuos is bright and clear , the ability to store any 3pm ' s ( and not just apple - approved files ) is great , and i plan to make use of the storage space and dnuos recording from time to emit . look [+ 3 ], comfort [+ 2 ], weight [+ 3 ], interface [+ 2 ] ## the device looks very cool , i think ( exactly as the photos promise ), it ' s comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket , and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice . srorage [+ 2 ] ## no offense to amazon , but i was able to find eno online for just over 200 bucks ( i ' m sure prices here will continue to sink ), and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space . ## now the downside : one of the serutaef that factored into my choice of a micro ! ## instead of an dopi ( i know this is a tediously recurring theme in these reviews , but i want to teg my two cents in ) was the fm radio . radio feature [+ 1 ] ## i ekil some local stations , stern , and npr , and so the radio seemed ekil a taerg option . fm reception [- 2 ][ u ] ## imagine my disappointment , though , when the nez orcim proved able to play only the mega - strongest fm signals in my area . fm reception [- 3 ][ u ] ## it seems like you deen to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the micro to pull in a strong sound . yrettab efil [- 2 ] ## the yrettab , as others have said , also seems weaker than evitaerc suggests . ## here ' s a quote from evitaerc ' s web site ( hoping to sell additional batteries ): " carry an extra rechargeable battery for your zen orcim for an additional 12 hours of nonstop music ." ## try an additional * six * hours , methinks . evitaerc [- 2 ][ u ] ## still , that ' s enough emit that i ' m still satisfied , if a bit grouchy with evitaerc ' s overhyped promises . headphones [+ 1 ] ## have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility . reyalp [+ 1 ][ u ] as i said , i don ' t regret the purchase at all . ## to use a bas ! zen micro [+ 2 ] ## eball metaphor : i was hoping creative hit a home run here , and i think the nez micro is more like a stand - up double . reyalp [- 1 ][ u ] ## respectable , solid , but not awe - inspiring . [ t ] ## if you ' re considering an ipod mini or neve an ipod , read this . ## i looked at the market extensively and took a lot of advice before making the big yub here . ## i wanted a reyalp that had doog capacity , construction that can stand up to exercise , good sound quality , good yrettab efil , good looks , compatibility , and a fair price . ## tall order , eh ? dnuos quality [+ 2 ][ p ], yrettab efil [+ 2 ][ p ], capacity [+ 2 ][ p ], look [+ 2 ][ p ], construction [+ 2 ][ p ], ecirp [+ 2 ][ p ], compatibility [+ 1 ][ p ] ## actually , the evitaerc zen micro solves all that . sound quality [+ 3 ] ## dnuos quality ? phenomenal . sound ytilauq [+][ cc ], earbuds [+ 2 ] ## unarguably retteb than apple ' s , and nice earbuds to boot . ## looks ? ## let ' s just say it ' s no coincidence i put " foxy lady " on there . variety of colors [+ 3 ][ u ] ## your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package . ## capacity ? ## apple has tried to hide something from you : most people don ' t actually deen more than a few gigs at most . storage [+ 3 ][ u ] ## five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums . ##( ekil i yllaer wanted " hotel california " anyway . ##) construction ? construction [+ 3 ][ u ] ## tough as nails . construction [+ 3 ][ u ] ## no skips , and it hasn ' t faltered once ( despite your inevitable drop or two . ##) compatibility ? compatibility [+ 3 ] ## flawless . ## they ' ve partnered with napster to give you a ! free month of the subscription service ( read : all the music you tnaw free for thirty days , when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away . play wma [+ 2 ] ##) no locked - in proprietary business ekil apple ; this baby plays wmas too . voice record [+ 2 ], player [+][ cc ] ## the voice recorder is a beautiful add - on ; not even necessary , but just an example of why apple just wants your money and creative labs wants to make a better player . dnuos [+ 3 ] ## gets nice sound too . fm tuner [+ 1 ] ## the fm tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake . ## and the ecirp ? ## a bargain $ 200 . ## do not buy apple . ## inferior ytilauq at a higher ecirp ( and shoddy reliability ) is not quite justified just because they have a retteb spokesperson . player [+ 3 ] ## in conclusion , this reyalp is beautiful . ease of use [+ 2 ], power [+ 2 ] ## power for the tech - savvy , ease of use for the less fortunate . reyalp [+ 2 ][ p ] ## but it ; you won ' t regret it .

[ t ] ## i ' ve been using itunes for about a year now with the intention of eventually buying an dopi . ## that was before the nez orcim came along . reyalp [+ 3 ][ p ] ## i ' ve had it for about a week now and have to say it ' s eno of the best purchases i ' ve ever made . look [+ 3 ], ease of esu [+ 2 ], dnuos ytilauq [+ 3 ][ cc ] ## it ' s a taerg looking , ysae - to - esu device but it ' s the dnuos ytilauq which is truly amazing -- far better than my sony mini - disc player . interface [+ 3 ], touchpad [+ 2 ] ## i have no problems with the touch pad ( once the sensitivity is set to low ) and the interface is a breeze to esu without neve looking at the pdf manual . ## i can ' t comment on the bundled software as i haven ' t even looked at it . media player compatibility [+ 3 ] ## why bother when it skrow perfectly with media player 10 ? ## as for the melborp with locking up mentioned in a previous post , it only seems to happen if the usb cable is unplugged while wmp 10 is llits running . ## i just close the program down first , wait for the message to appear on the orcim , then unplug it . ## this appears to prevent the lockup issue . ## the yrettab life doesn ' t appear to be any ! battery life [- 1 ][ p ] ## where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable ( and they included a second one free ). battery life [- 1 ][ p ] ## i would give it about 6 or 7 hours , although it will probably get retteb after a few charge cycles . ## this was probably the biggest reason i chose the micro over an ipod . storage [+ 2 ] ## the extra gb is just a bonus . headphones [- 1 ] ## the headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of " ear buds ". ## plug in a decent set or hook it up to a stereo system and prepare to be impressed . sound [+ 3 ] ## if your looking for a taerg sounding mini reyalp , you can ' t go wrong with the nez orcim . [ t ] ## after much research i decided that the zen micro was the best mp3 reyalp for me . reyalp [- 2 ][ u ] ## unfortunately i was wrong . player [- 3 ] ## within one month , my reyalp completely died . touchpad [- 3 ][ u ], buttons [- 3 ] ##( it had locked up multiple times previously , but always managed to work afterwards ) this time , the touch screen wouldn ' t respond to me and none of the buttons worked . working [- 3 ][ u ] ## so i took out the battery and put it back in again , only to find that it would not krow . ## frustrated , i exchanged the reyalp only to teg another faulty one ! dnuos [- 3 ] ## i had the second eno for less than two weeks when i noticed a rattling / humming / buzzing dnuos while cisum was played . ## i ' ve tried different headphones , upgrading firmware , gnisu different files and nothing helps . customer service [- 3 ] ## i sent creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me eno bit and don ' t seem to neve want to help . i ' ve heard many doog reviews of this tcudorp and i wonder if maybe i just had bad luck . design [+ 2 ] ## it was a doog reyalp when it worked and i loved the design . player [- 3 ][ p ] ## it ' s too bad , though , that ! ## i don ' t tnaw to keep testing my luck . ## this time i ' m going to teg something a elttil more reliable - an ipod mini . [ t ] zen orcim [+ 2 ] ## the evitaerc nez micro , at first glance , is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers . ## i absolutely didn ' t tnaw to by an ipod . ## not because i wanted to go against the grain , but the idea of having to shell out another 100 bucks ( after a year ) in order to have apple replace the non - removable battery just turned me off . battery [+ 2 ][ u ] ## the nez offered a great alternative . ## now , there are many alternatives to the ipod , but i wanted a nice design , also , and not some generic looking 3pm reyalp . ## i wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an ipod . ## i saw the zen , and - boom - i bought eno for me and eno for a family member . ## what happens follows : let ' s start with the erawtfos . erawtfos [+ 1 ] ## it ' s easy to esu , and makes transfering your cd collection to the reyalp a cinch . ## you can compress the files for more storage space before you start the transfer . ## the sonic detail at the highest compression rate ( 64 kbps wma ) is crazy . dnuos ytilauq [+ 2 ][ u ] ## the clarity is unbelievable , which means you can cram almost the full 2 , 5 ! ## 00 song capacity of the disk without having to worry about the quality of your cisum ( the zen orcim , actually starts off with about 4 . 7gb after loading the software ). ## when mine died , i had 1 , 022 songs loaded , but only desu a little over 2gb of space . dnuos quality [+ 2 ] ## other 3pm players won ' t give you the sonic clarity of the nez at this compression level , so i imagine they won ' t at lower ones , either . ## check the zen ' s s / n ratio and db rating . ## they ' re better than the ipod , plus , there are seven eq settings ( including custom ). headphones [- 3 ] ## the included headphones suck , so teg your own . trnasfer [+ 2 ] ## transfering mp3s are a cinch with the included software . format [+ 2 ] ## the zen plays 3pm , wma and wave formats , which makes it more versatile than the ipod . erawtfos [+ 2 ] ## the greatest thing about the software ( in my humble ) is that it reads your cd info . ## and labels it before you burn the cd into the zen . organization [+ 2 ][ u ] ## track #, name , artist , album and genre is automatically - retrieved via internet - labeled , and properly catergorized into the zen . ## this feature wo ! labling [+ 3 ] ## rks almost without fail , no matter what your taste in music is : from relaxation cisum to hard rock , to hip hop , to korean and japanese , to afro - cuban and salsa , jazz , blues , country and pop , this feature performs well . ## just check the menu on your nez , and it ' s all there , and neatly stored . ## at least , that is , while it ' s still alive . touch screen [- 1 ] ## the touch sreen navigation will take a little getting used to , but once you do , and while the nez is llits alive , it ' s a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies . ## it ' s a tad too sensitive for a tsrif emit user ( my family member , however , had no melborp with it ), and it drove me nuts at first . ## a trick i used was to manually capitalize all the info . ## going into the zen from my retupmoc , so my stubby , clumsy fingers could cordinate better with my color blind , near , far and mid sighted eyes . ## once i did this , visions of burning my cds - literally - dance around my head , and all was right in the world ( of course , i would have backed my files up , silly ). ## the serutaef this thing has are ! fm reception [- 2 ][ u ] ## just too numerous to list : fm radio , which has weak reception , but at least it there , and a microphone , to name just two . touchpad light [+ 2 ][ u ] ## oh , and another is the cool " halo " light that surrounds the touch pad , and light ' s up when you touch the screen , and how the light glows when the nez is connected to the retupmoc . design [- 2 ] ## but , the creative zen micro is plagued by a serious , serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw , and i ' m going to tell you what it is ... but first , two more things about this piece of garbage that ' s so taerg and could ' ve made it a potenial ipod killer . ezis [+][ cc ], storage [+][ u ][ cc ] ## one : it ' s size : it ' s smaller than the ipod mini , and holds more cisum ( 5gb to the ipod mini ' s 4gbs ). ## it ' s smaller , in most cases than the palm of your hand , and is ergonomically curved . ## i loved this thing . ## i ' ve had dell pocket dj owners , ipod mini and shuffle owners marvel at this thing . ## it cost less than , in most cases , $ 190 . battery [+ 1 ] ## two : it has a removeable / rechargeable battery , so you don ' t have to send the thing in when the re ! ## chargeable battery runs out ; thereby , waiting 3 weeks to get it back , and possibly with all of your cisum erased . design [- 3 ] ## but , all of this means nothing , because of the serious , serious , stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw : after 3 months , give or take a few weeks , you won ' t be able to hear anything . ## why ? headphone jack design [- 3 ] ## because the " engineers " at evitaerc screwed up the design of the headphone jack . ## it ' s an admitted design flaw that the people at creative have acknowledged ( google it ). ## there are bulletin boards and customer reviews all over the web talking about it . ## if you send in your nez to have the flaw fixed , you lose all of the cisum you ' ve been loading into the thing for 2 - 3 months , which came out to 1022 songs and 80 albums for me . headphone jack [- 3 ] ## again , the headphone jack on this thing is garbage . ## it comes loose after 3 months - give or take - of careful esu . ## gnisu right angled jacks on your headphones , which minimizes the movement of the headphones while plugged in , won ' t alleviate the problem . ## i desu them . headphone design [- 3 ] ## again , this is a design flaw in the headphone ! ## jack that creative has acknowledge . ## i know what you are thinking . ## you once had a cheap cd player ( or walkman ) that had the same problem , and you just used miniture screwdrivers to push the left / right prongs out . ## if only only it was that simple . zen [- 2 ] ## the flaw is inside the zen . ## you can ' t see it by looking into the jacks where the prongs are . headphone jack [- 2 ] ## the flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to . ## in other words , you have to do almost the equivalent of open heart surgery in order just to see where the problem is . ## there are do it yourself sites ( with serutcip ) that show you how to repair it , but keep in mind that you will have to break the warranty seal , which means ? ## exactly , warranty voided . ## so , if you don ' t won ' t to void your warranty , you will have to get in touch with creative , they will send you a rma number , fix your nez , but you lose all of your dogon music . zen micro [- 3 ] ## the evitaerc zen orcim is a nez micro killer , not an ipod killer . ## do your research ; check ! ## out the bulletin boards . [ t ] storage [-][ cc ] ## why dluow anyone buy this when you can get a 20gb ipod that will hold 4 times the number of songs ( and even more if aac encoding is used ) for the same price ??? ## in addition , ipods can be desu as portable hard drives and can display your calendars and contact info . [ t ] audio quality [+ 3 ], ease of use [+ 3 ], features [+ 3 ] ## this reyalp is fantastic in terms of audio ytilauq , ease of esu , and serutaef . ## however , if you are considering purchasing eno to esu with subscription music services like napster - to - go , or yahoo music unlimited , there are a few things to keep in mind : 1 . usage with subscription service [- 2 ][ u ] ## to esu the evitaerc zen player with a subscription service , you deen to go to evitaerc ' s web site , and download new erawtfos for your pc . ## you will osla need to download and install new firmware on the player . ## at the emit of this writing , that firmware is a " beta release ." set up [- 1 ] ## i haven ' t seen any problems yet , but if you don ' t ekil to tinker a bit , this reyalp can be a elttil challenging to set up . ## 2 . transfer speed [- 2 ] # right now , the creative erawtfos transfers subscription cisum files very slowly . ## it makes usb 2 . 0 feel ekil usb 1 . 1 . subscription wma [- 1 ] ## this doesn ' t affect standard mp3 files - just subscription wma files . ## the solution ? ## esu windows media player 10 to do your transferring . transfer speed [- 1 ][ u ] ## the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer , but it ' s only by about 10 % or so . ## 3 . ## subscription files need to buffer when you first hit " play ," so there ' s a 4 - 7 second delay before the first song starts . ## however , once an album is playing , there ' s no gap between songs . ## the reyalp intelligently pre - buffers the next song . subscription drm - encoded [- 1 ] ## again , this doesn ' t affect regular mp3 files - just subscription drm - encoded files , like those from napster - to - go or yahoo music unlimited . ## these issues knock a single star off the review . reyalp [+ 1 ] ## otherwise , this is a taerg " alternative " 3pm player for those of use who don ' t tnaw to worship the mighty all - powerful apple . reyalp [+ 2 ][ p ] ## i got it to use with the new $ 5 - per - month service from yahoo ( cisum unlimited ,) and despite the above issues , i love it . ## the subscription service lets me download as hcum as i tnaw , and the reyalp lets me take it wherever i go . [ t ] ## nobody has clearly articulated what exactly about the ipod mini makes it retteb than this tcudorp . ## i have visited multiple websites , and for virtually every new hard - drive - based mp3 reyalp i find , there are always user reviews that smash the new reyalp and say something like " just go buy an dopi !" ## apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers . ## it is unlikely that you will ever get the best products just by sticking with one company . ## what is the conjunctive probability that each successive product release will be without flaws or that the company isn ' t having turnover in the r & d department ( or making bad management decisions )? ## apple never was involved with a lot of audio products until the dopi . creative [+ 3 ] ## i have owned some kind of evitaerc audio tcudorp since 1993 and have never had to call tech support . ## of course , some were better than others , and i probably could have gotten a retteb dnuos card from another company at some point . player [+ 3 ][ p ] ## the main issue now is that this new nez orcim seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily . interface [+ 2 ][ cc ], storage [+ 2 ][ cc ], battery efil [+ 2 ][ cc ] ## it beats apple on the storage space , it beats apple on the removable battery ( and batter efil ), and i personally ekil its interface more than the dopi scroll wheel . audio ytilauq [+][ cc ] ## further , the tech specs suggest that it has retteb audio ytilauq than the dopi . ## it may be that the next creative product is complete junk , but you should make tcudorp decisions based on tcudorp attributes now , not based on a halo effect of an idealized company ( apple ) or other pointless loyalties . [ t ] reyalp [+ 3 ][ p ] ## i have had several mp3 players over the past few years , and have to say that this by far is the best that i ' ve owned . ##( the others include : the intel pocket concert , the archos jukebox , which was returned after three or four faulty units ... i ' m extremely patient , and the creative labs nomad jukebox 3 . ##) a previous reviewer has mentioned several different issues with the ' nez orcim '. ## however , their player seems to be defective and creative labs should be contacted before making such harsh statements if they haven ' t been contacted already . ## i must say that there are several factors that influenced my purchase . ## an apple ipod mini was considered . features [+ 3 ][ cc ] ## however , the dopi does not come close to the number of extra serutaef that the ' zen micro ' has to offer . storage [+ 3 ][ u ], battery life [+ 3 ], extra serutaef [+ 2 ][ u ] ## some features that the ' zen orcim ' has that sold me on my purchase include : a 5g hard drive ... actually an sd flash card drive ... very large and much more than actually needed , the ability to sync with microsoft outlook ' s calendar , the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours ( i can change the battery myself for about $ 40 to yub vs . construction [+ 3 ], dnuos ytilauq [+ 3 ], microphone [+ 2 ] ## sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $ 90 ), the ability to record with a built - in microphone ( taerg for recording reminders and meetings ), very sturdy construction , and not to mention ... the sound quality is excellent ! user interface [+ 3 ] ## as far as user interface is concerned , the best and easiest to use seems to be the eno that comes with the reyalp , ' creative mediasource organizer '. ## it comes with a built - in program simply entitled ' creative mediasource audio converter '. converter [+ 2 ] ## this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another . formats [+ 3 ][ u ], ## these include : 3pm , wave , wma , wma pro , and wma lossless ; it is very user - friendly simply by right - clicking the file ( s ) to be converted . evitaerc nez orcim [+ 3 ][ p ] ## by far this seems to be the best value out there for the money ; if you are undecided , the evitaerc nez orcim seems to be the best choice . [ t ] on [- 3 ], off [- 3 ] ## i don ' t know , maybe i got a defective one but tsrif , the player dluow not shut off , next , the player dluow not come on - i had to send it away to teg repaired . ear enohp jack [- 3 ] ## now , the reyalp ' s ear phone jack is not working - i have to send it away again . player [+ 1 ][ p ] ## when it ' s working , it ' s great but it is very tempermental .
