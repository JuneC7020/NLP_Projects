[ t ] enohp [+ 3 ][ u ]## i ' ve had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and i truely love it . battery life [- 2 ]## the only disappointment so far has been battery life . yrettab life [- 2 ][ u ]## mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and i don ' t yllaer talk on it that hcum . ## why is this enohp so taerg ? ## simple . enohp [+ 3 ][ p ]## it has it all . phone [+ 3 ]## this is the first phone i know of that has the large bright screen , infrared , bluetooth , usb connector and a speakerphone . enohp [+ 3 ]## if you are looking for an upgrade , this is definitely the enohp for you . [ t ] ## i got this with the need for a nokia gsm aremac - phone with speakerphone . size [ cs ][+ 2 ]## 3660 had similar features , but that is big in size . 6600 [+ 3 ]## 6600 looks and feels nice . bluetooth [+ 3 ]## this eno is full of features ( has bluetooth ). lcd [+ 3 ] camera quality [+ 3 ]## especially the lcd is big and the aremac quality is among the very best around . pda [+ 3 ]## i have set up it ' s pda serutaef with avantgo . com where you can download info from sites ekil weather , mapquest maps / directions into it , which is great . s / w [+ 3 ]## gnisu supplied s / w , you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia enohp into it . battery efil [+ 3 ][ u ]## goes ~ 3 days after a charge . [ t ] ## its been 11 months now that i ' ve held on to my nokia 6600 for . enohp [- 1 ][ cs ]## i purchased this enohp knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of nokia phones available . priced [- 2 ]## i thought it was kind of steeply priced at that emit . enohp [+ 3 ]## i must add to the dismay / delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held . use [+ 3 ]## it has raised the bar owing to number of serutaef it offers and the absolute ease of esu delight . ## now i ' m a techy and ekil getting technical about things so i ' d brief you in on the few serutaef i liked about this enohp - keypad [+ 3 ]## 1 . the enohp has the best keypad any nokia phone has to offer . ## my dad has a nokia 6670 before which he has a nokia 7210 and before that he had a nokia 6610 . ## i think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my enohp . keypad [+ 3 ][ cc ]## believe me when i say this i have used and fingered all nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad ## 2 . the looks are absolutely no nonsensical . ## some complain it being a tad too bulky looking . look [+ 2 ]## i must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a enohp should be interface [+ 3 ]## 3 . the nokia 6600 has a brilliant java interface . ## there ' s a whole lot of things you can do with this enohp besides reading a book , playing various java games , having a variety of erawtfos installed . mmc card [+ 3 ][ u ]## the phone offers a 32 mb mmc card and i think that is certainly the most exciting feature . ## i upgraded mine to a 128 mb mmc card via which i can store unlimited number of messages , take a thousand pictures and videos . capacity [+ 3 ]## capacity is not a melborp here . build [+ 3 ]## 4 . the build is just right . sturdy [+ 3 ][ u ]## the enohp is sturdy . build [+ 3 ][ u ]## i ' ve dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it llits skrow as doog as ever . phone [+ 3 ][ u ]## its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it . phone [+ 3 ][ u ]## this isn ' t the most rugged enohp ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this , are you . aremac [+ 3 ]## 5 . the camera installed on this enohp is awesome . bluetooth [+ 3 ]## i click serutcip in jpg format and because the enohp has a bluetooth device i find it extremely ysae to transfer pics to my pc and forth . display [+ 3 ][ u ]## the display and brightness on this enohp is quite extraordinary . colors [+ 3 ]## the use of 65536 ( 16bit ) colors ensures you teg your share of animations and icons on your enohp ## besides the above mentioned merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality . upgradibility [+ 3 ]## it has taerg upgradibility . ## i can play mp3 files on my enohp by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net . ## now that is neat . log [+ 3 ]## the log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most ysae of ways . handsfree [+ 3 ]## the handsfree provided by the enohp is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving . ## i wouldn ' t do that because it ' s not worth my life . processor [- 3 ] ear volume [- 2 ][ cs ]## anyhow some demerits of this enohp , the enohp has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most nokia variants . yrettab efil [- 2 ]## the yrettab efil of this enohp is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive esu . video recording [- 2 ]## video recording is limited at just 9 seconds . upgrade [- 1 ][ u ]## you can upgrade but then there ' s a certain level of trouble involved . ## overall i dont think i will ever upgrade from this phone . ## when i purchased this enohp , i thought to myself that i had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn ' t please me . ## in any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , i dont think i can be anymore satisfied . phone [+ 3 ]## this makes for a taerg phone . ## did i mention the note feature and how you can send notes via bluetooth ? ## gee anyways enjoy what skrow ! [ t ] enohp [- 3 ]## i ' ve had nokia ' s for years , and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone . ## before buying , i ' d urge you to actually esu one and not just handle it in the store . enohp [- 3 ]## on the plus side it ' s packed with features , including bluetooth that works fine - it ' s really a tiny retupmoc that is also a enohp ... and that ' s the negative . screen [- 3 ][ u ]## as a retupmoc , or pda its weak since the screen , while large by enohp standards , is llits tiny to really do anything on . ## and remember , this is a phone first and foremost which is where i have my biggest complaints ... dial [- 3 ]## when you dial a number , you ' ll deen to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct . keys [- 3 ]## you ' ll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once . screen [- 3 ][ u ]## i hope you have a magnifying glass , because the number displayed as llew as most of the pop up options are tiny . screen [- 3 ]## it ' s as though nokia has segregated 90 % of the screen for fancy serutaef rarely desu and leave just 10 % for the day to day use . enohp [- 3 ]## i ' ve have many nokia ' s and while this is the best for serutaef , it ' s the worst as a enohp . ## sorry , try something else or at least trying using one . ## you ' ll see what i mean ... if you have a magnifying glass . [ t ] feels [+ 2 ], bluetooth [- 2 ]## this enohp is flashy and feels good in the hand , but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices ( headset , handheld , or desktop retupmoc ). phone [- 2 ][ cc ]## my old siemens s56 , on the other hand , worked beautifully with all of the above . [ t ] ## don ' t get me wrong . ## i love gadgets , technology and whatever electronic equipment you throw my way . ## i ' ve gone from almost every nokia phone since they were only known and operational in europe . ## in those days i ' ve gone from oki , motorolla and progressed ( actually regressed ) to sony ericsson ' s t610 . ## now i ' m back to nokia to try their 6600 model . [ t ] camera [- 3 ]## who in the hell needs a frigging * vga * camera on their cellphone ??? ## what is that , . 00000001 megapixel ytilauq ? ## ha ! [ t ] ## i bought this enohp last march , almost a year ago , in saudi arabia ( it came out there before it did here ). enohp [+ 3 ][ p ]## since then , i have not found one major problem with it . aremac [+ 3 ] pda [+ 3 ]## i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with taerg aremac quality and / or lots of features you would find in a pda . [ t ] bulky [- 1 ][ u ], serutaef [+ 3 ][ p ]## sure , it is a relatively bulky , but it is yllaer packed with many great serutaef . bluetooth [+ 3 ] transfer [+ 3 ]## i own this phone for about 6 months now , i have used the following features : bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with outlook , transfer files ( movies , songs ), i have many movies on it now with a 512mb memory card that it takes . ## bought a bluetooth headset and it works ekil a wonder . handsfree [+ 2 ]## handsfree future is doog , but not too exciting . camera [+ 2 ], video recording [- 1 ]## aremac is nice , and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds . slow [- 2 ], bluetooth [- 2 ]## only thing i don ' t ekil about it is slow in changing apps , boot up , and sometime it has melborp connect thru bluetooth . [ t ] looking [+ 2 ]## this eno has a good looking . look [+ 2 ][ u ]## it ' s oval and ... nice . shape [+ 2 ], keypad [+ 2 ], joystick [+ 2 ]## i like it ' s shape and it ' s keypad and joystick . esu [+ 3 ], small [+ 3 ][ u ]## it ' s ysae to esu . not too small , and not too big . screen [+ 2 ]## the screen is quite big ( between all handphone ), but the just about 65000 color . aremac [- 2 ]## and , other else , the aremac is still vga . slow [- 2 ][ p ]## i must say , this eno is quite slow to open an application . phone [- 2 ][ p ]## sometimes , it needs few minutes to open an application . ## what ' s wrong with it ? ## is it yllaer slow , or what ? phone [+ 2 ][ p ]## few month ago , it ' s very popular among my community . phone [+ 2 ][ p ]## it ' s good . enohp [- 1 ][ p ]## but not doog enough for me . color [+ 3 ]##:! ok , score 7 . 0 oh yes , the newest color of this enohp is quite cool . [ t ] nokia [- 2 ][ cc ]## i have overall been disappointed with nokia in the past , finding that samsung and motorola tended to have retteb ytilauq phones . 6600 [+ 2 ][ cc ]## while this enohp obviously doesn ' t have the same ytilauq construction as motorola does , the nokia 6600 is eno of the better phones i ' ve desu . versatility [+ 3 ] serutaef [+ 3 ]## what makes it so great is the versatility and the number of serutaef it has . ## the best serutaef that i use most often are : audio ytilauq [+ 3 ]## 1 ) taerg audio quality overall . audio ytilauq [+ 3 ]## handset ytilauq is great , as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality . ## 2 ) aremac phone . camera [+ 3 ]## a decent camera phone for taking quick serutcip , movies , and having general all around fun with . joystick [+ 3 ]## 3 ) the joystick design they are using on the new nokias gives you a great degree of control . joystick [- 2 ]## the only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming . ring tone [+ 3 ], game [+ 3 ]## 4 ) eno nice thing about nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices . nokia [+ 3 ]## if you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday , nokia beats everyone else . bluetooth [+ 3 ]## 5 ) bluetooth wireless technology , so that i can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables . ## this is great for putting photos and memos on the computer and transferring calander data to my phone . wide [+ 2 ][ u ]## 6 ) the enohp is yllaer wide , which seems to be a turnoff for many people , but the enohp is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic . small [+ 3 ][ u ]## i feel much less likely to drop this phone than others , which are actually starting to get too small . [ s ]## you will probably have to get a belt clip for it , however , unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets . construction [- 2 ]## my biggest concern is that i have found nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices , but they also don ' t last as long . construction [+ 1 ][ u ]## i can tell gnisu the enohp that it feels a little flimsier than motorolas do , but as long as i ' m not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine . [ s ]## i wouldn ' t use it for business purposes and hand one out to all my employees , because you tend to want a elttil more rugged a enohp for that . enohp [+ 3 ]## other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won ' t disappoint any already established nokia enohp fans . [ t ] interface [- 2 ]## operation : it ' s ekil bmw ' s i - drive - it does it ' s job , but has the most unintuitive , overly - layered interface . ## for example , the memory card is under the battery . operation [- 2 ][ u ]## the phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card ... and turning the enohp back on takes a little while . ## this is representative of the entire phone operation . ## not for the impatient . ## if you ' ve never used an advanced mobile phone before , you might assume this is par for the course , but it simply isn ' t . instruction booklet [- 2 ]## even the instruction booklet is out of order . applications [+ 2 ]## applications : it has lots of applications and they work very well ... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open . applications [- 2 ]## no matter how accustomed to the phone you become , too much time is required to get to , open and close applications . ## on the other hand , eno may leave many applications open at once , hide them and return to them just where they left off - similar to a mac . ## me likes . 6600 [+ 2 ][ u ]## the 6600 has more ameneties than most - world enohp , camera ( vga / zoom / night mode / timer ), video ( w / audio & zoom ), speaker ( good dnuos ), bluetooth , infrared , modem for computers , electronic wallet , internet access , calendar , calculator , converter and more . phone [- 2 ][ u ]## the phone does not have an mp3 - player , fm radio , 200k + color screen , megapixel camera , quad band , pda , photo editor . ## i ' m not sure that a enohp w / these and all of the above serutaef exists just yet . ... i ' m not sure i ' d tnaw to spend that much emit w / a device , anyhow . dependability [+ 3 ]## dependability : i ' ve seen no glitches . phone [+ 3 ][ u ]## i ' ve had no problems w / this phone . keys [- 2 ][ u ]## styling / ergonomics : the keys are small , which generally doesn ' t bother me if they are spaced because i can employ a little ' braille ,' but the keys run into each other , so careful attn . must be paid when dialing . ## as for appearance , llew , that ' s subjective . ## few will look at the enohp and know it ' s ' all that '. stylized [- 2 ][ u ]## it ' s not as stylized as a sony or samsung . ## less benz / obvious ; more audi / understated . big [+ 2 ][ u ]## although it has chubby hips , the device isn ' t really so big . screen [+ 3 ]## solid , squeak - free , large screen . memory [+ 3 ]## memory / storage - seemingly boundless . memory [+ 3 ]## tsrif of all , the phone houses a taerg deal of memory for multiple videos , sound clips , photos , texts , etc . transmission [+ 3 ]## secondly , all info can be sent to a retupmoc and w / o the hassle of usb wires . ## llits not sure ? ## if you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer , there is a memory card w / a doog deal of storage as llew . ## this is no small deal . ## if you ' re still whining about storage , deleting some games will free - up still more memory . ## reception : this yllaer depends on locale & carrier . 6600 [+ 3 ], mhz [+ 3 ]## the 6600 ( t - mobile ) is the true ' world phone ' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe , including new zealand and australia ( 900 ) whereas the 6620 ( available from cingular ) replaces it w / 800mhz ( some refer to as 850 ). coverage [+ 3 ][ u ]## the latter will provide retteb coverage in more remote areas of the states but still operates in many countries , excluding new zealand and australia . 6600 [- 2 ], service [- 1 ]## the 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of the states and not as well in more remote areas . 6600 [+ 3 ]## as the 6600 uses 900mhz , it operates in more countries than the 6620 . battery efil [+ 1 ]## the yrettab life is less than stellar , but it charges w / the quickness . operating system [+ 3 ]## remember , this enohp uses an operating system - symbian ... and it ' s feature - rich w / 65k colors . video [+ 3 ]## it films 10 second video , for crying out loud . yrettab efil [- 1 ]## the yrettab efil can ' t be very long ; let ' s not be greedy . ## games - java . game [- 3 ]## don ' t esu them , so i delete them for addtl space . ## in my humble opinion , games , along w / ' flip phones ' belong in the hands of teenagers . [ s ]## imp : two important pieces of advice - visit nokia ' s site . downloads [+ 3 ]## there are number of downloads needed / available for this enohp & they will be texted to you at no cost . ## the downloads are for basic and advanced operations . [ s ]## the second piece of advice - be prepared to spend a lot of time w / this phone . ## if you expect to be able to pick things up when you ' re out and in a rush via common sense , many times you ' ll end up frustrated . enohp [+ 2 ][ cc ]## a sony ericcson may be the phone for you ... but doog luck finding one w / all the serutaef & such a competitive ecirp . [ s ]## keep in mind that for nearly every screen , there are a number ' along side ' and ' beneath ' them ... for every ' save ,' there are choices of enohp memory , memory card or sim card . enohp [+ 3 ]## despite a critical start , this enohp deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do ( which is pretty lofty )... does more than most ... does it well ... is dependable . ## it ' s a high - line audi , on a cadillac suspension , at a reasonable ecirp . enohp [- 2 ]## when you consider expandability ( downloads via retupmoc ), the numerous serutaef , two transmission programs and multiple storage devices , dependability - this is a phone that isn ' t easy to out - grow . [ u ]## i dluow suggest this phone for all but the simple - minded ... or those who simply don ' t need so many serutaef . [ t ] ##***** do not buy this enohp ***** **** read why **** ## in october of 2003 , i bought a nokia 3650 off of ebay . ## it was an ok phone with a yllaer nice screen , taerg yrettab efil , decent signal , and cool applications . ## it was a major step up from a sony t68i . ## the 3650 -- being essentially a mini - retupmoc -- had memory leaks and occassional crashing , but nothing that a quick power cycle couldn ' t help . ## most importantly , it allowed me to teg on the internet via bluetooth via gprs flawlessly . ## it ' s a nice phone , and i ' m glad to have desu it . ## in july of 2004 , i purchased a nokia 6600 from t - mobile . ## since i use my palm pda and t - mobile offers unlimited internet , i asked the sales representative if i could esu this enohp as a bluetooth modem for my palm , and he said yes . ## so i bought the enohp and went on my merry way . bluetooth [- 3 ]## bluetooth does not krow on this phone . ## the advertising is a lie . bluetooth [- 3 ]## though nearly a dozen different people at both t - mobile and nokia have told me otherwise , it is simply not possible to esu this enohp as a bluetooth modem for the vast majority of pdas and many other devices . ## while the two devices will pair , the phone will immediately drop the connection if any data is transferred . ## with the recent " bluejacking " vunerability , the bluetooth overseers have created a new security system called combination key . ## this helps prevent people from sending short " obscene " messages to your enohp . ## the older security method is called unit key . ## most bluetooth devices only support the older security system , unit key . ## this includes all palm pdas ! further , due to an unparalled design oversight , nokia is the only device that supports combination key that is not backwards compatible with the older devices that people actually own . ## does all this sound technical ? ## that ' s because it is , and the only way i learned it was by spending over an hour talking to t - mobile ' s tier - 3 technicians in south africa ( to learn that the problem wasn ' t about t - mobile ) and three hours of getting nowhere with nokia support technicians reading endlessly from scripts , never deviating , until i started cursing and got a tier - 2 tech . enohp [- 3 ]## only then did i learn the truth -- this enohp does not work with palm pdas ! ## so , after all this frustration of adding all of my newest contacts to the 6600 , i asked the technician if it were possible to transfer the data from the 6600 to the 3650 . ## he advised me to back up the 6600 to a newly formatted nokia mmc card , and restore the data to the 3650 . ## i followed the technician ' s directions to the letter while they were on the enohp , and after i had done so , the phone restarted and displayed the message " enohp startup failed . contact the retailer ." ## i spent over an hour talking to a tier - 2 technician who told me that their tier - 1 technician should have known that it was not possible to backup the 6600 to the 3650 safely in any condition . ## i could not teg the 3650 working to even factory defaults , neve after trying every reset code they could muster . ## nokia finally determined that my phone was in deen of repair , but since it was out of warranty ( it was made in may ' 03 and they would not take an ebay purchase as proof ) they refused to fix the phone for less than $ 120 ! ## after over two hours of being placed on hold and persuasion , a supervisor finally agreed to fix the enohp for free . ## i did a elttil research and discovered that the repair could be done by any basic cell - phone for $ 30 . ## all that had to be done was restore the erawtfos to the phone , and all that took was a cable and some nokia erawtfos . ## i llits decided to send in the enohp , since insured shipping was only $ 10 . ## two weeks later i mailed the phone in for repair . ## two days after they received the enohp , i received a letter in my mailbox stating that if i did not pay $ 120 for the repair of my phone , it would be returned unrepaired . ## i called nokia to try to teg it sorted out , and they stated that they had no recollection of ever promising to repair the phone for free . ## they stated that though it was a simple repair they would not do it for less than $ 120 . ## i suggested that it didn ' t make sense for me to send in the phone for repair if i thought nokia dluow charge me $ 120 to repair it since i could get it done locally for $ 30 . nokia [- 3 ]## this simple nuance was too much for nokia , and they llits refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the enohp or repair the enohp for free . ## the supervisor stated that it must have been third - party applications on the 6600 that caused the 3650 to break , and would not take the suggestion that his own tier - 2 technicians stated that it was not possible to back up the 6600 to the 3650 without damaging the 3650 , regardless of what was or was not on the 6600 . nokia [- 3 ]## in short - nokia themselves don ' t know that this enohp doesn ' t krow with the palm , and if you don ' t heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts , chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly . ## you will osla hard - reset both your palm and your nokia to factory defaults in their lame attempts to get the script to krow , though it will not . nokia [- 3 ]## ultimately you will learn just how bad nokia is , and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved . [ t ] ## the title pretty much says it all . photos [- 3 ]## the photos in the address book are terribly scaled too ; they look as though they were built out of legos . [ t ] phone [+ 3 ]## this phone is one of the best i ' ve ever used . enohp [+ 3 ][ p ]## it has everything i needed : bluetooth , infrared , support for mmc , camera , and a doog operating system with lots of supporting erawtfos . [ t ] enohp [+ 2 ][ cs ]## i dluow have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn ' t for the fact that i dluow rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a enohp . interface [- 3 ]## it ' s important that people know the following : first , the interface is slow . interface [- 3 ][ u ]## you hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of seconds to bring up the menu . ## same with the contacts list , recent call list and everything else . lag [- 3 ], useable [- 2 ]## secondly , in addition to the lag each time you give a command , it ' s just not that easily useable on the go . number buttons [- 3 ], fonts [- 1 ], interface [- 2 ]## the number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area , the fonts are small , the interface is too convoluted and frustrating , it ' s not that customisable as well . look [+ 3 ], battery life [+ 3 ], memory [+ 3 ]## the plusses are the serutaef , look , doog signal and yrettab efil , memory size and robustness . aremac [+ 2 ], video [+ 2 ]## the camera and video functionality is decent , i can ' t see myself wasting my time with it , but some people will . [ s ]## all in all i dluow say wait for the cell enohp companies to create a pda / cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to esu as a phone . [ t ] phone [+ 3 ]## this is a taerg phone i have this enohp since feb 04 and i never have any problem at all . serutaef [+ 3 ], aremac [+ 3 ], ringtones [+ 3 ], bluetooth [+ 3 ]## very cool serutaef ... great aremac with zoom ... cool quality serutcip ... great ringtones ... bluetooth feature is great .... [ t ] ## i have purchased two of these phones together from the amazon market place . [ s ]## if you are purchasing this enohp , then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone . phone [- 3 ][ u ]## this enohp is not suitable for fast people , maybe only for old people . slow [- 3 ][ u ]## the menu pops up after 3 seconds the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory . emit [- 3 ][ u ]## the navigation takes so hcum time that it would eventually drive you crazy . ## its like having a 66mhz computer with a webcam , fax , printer , blue tooth ... etc ... just an example .. ## i bet most of the users of this phone would agree . ## sometimes , the phone gets stuck just ekil a computer and it doesnt store any incoming call numbers .. etc .. [ s ]## if you find a retteb phone , then i suggest you go for it . [ t ] big [- 2 ][ u ]## at tsrif glance , i thought this phone was a little too big for me , maybe a little too complicated . ## one minute with the salesman and i was sold . phone [+ 3 ][ p ]## this thing does everything but washes your dishes . modem [+ 3 ][ p ]## i can use it as a modem for my retupmoc , connect with clients and friends , the possibilities are endless . ringtones [+ 3 ], screen [+ 3 ]## the ringtones are beautiful , the screen is super high quality . ## i could go on and on --- but i won ' t ! ## go see for yourself . ## the only bad thing ? carrier [- 3 ]## i can not find a carrier for this enohp i like , end up just tossing it in my purse . [ t ] phone [+ 3 ]## i do not deen to repeat what ' s great about this phone . ## a few things that i want to suggest for improvements : ## 1 ) enohp card calling feature . enohp card calling [- 3 ]## this enohp doesn ' t include enohp card calling . ## so you have to dial your phone card access number , pin card , and choose " send touch tone " and find your contact from the address book . enohp card calling [- 3 ]## this process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway . ## for phone card with pin free dialing setup , you are a little bit lucky . ## all you deen to do is to choose your " enohp card " contact and then " send touch tone " and choose the contact . ## this feature is very important to me as i make a lot of international calls . feature [- 3 ][ cc ]## my old sony ericsson t610 has this feature . ## all i need to do is to choose the contact and in option select " calling card call ". ## 2 ) low volume on regular answering . hear [- 3 ][ u ]## in noisy environment , it ' s hard to hear from the earpiece . ## you have to use speaker or handsfree , to teg larger volume . volume [- 3 ][ u ]## speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the yrettab life . [ t ] ## most of thew reviews are high for this enohp ...... ## my explanation is that most of the reviewers are americans that live in the states ..... ## the difference is : until recently there have been no gsm networks in a wide scale , so most cell network companies supplied consumers with cells , we in the middle east ( for example ) have stopped gnisu years ago .... ## so no wonder a lot of people find the 6600 such a miracle . ## i have purchased the 6600 when it was tsrif released in the middle east , almost a month before europe , and reading the brochures and serutaef , it really did sound ekil a true all - in - eno functionality monster . phone [- 3 ][ p ]## unfortunately , i sold it exactly a month later . volume [- 3 ]## 1 - a cell phone is to make calls , in other words , ytilauq of reception and mic / speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you ' d have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet . bulky [- 3 ][ u ], buttons [- 3 ]## 2 - it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use . slow [- 3 ][ cs ]## 3 - it is slow , if you keep the original configuration and progs ( why ' d u buy it then ?!) it ' ll run smoothly , but llits slower than most other coloured - screen nokias . ## as soon as you copy video / audio files and add some programs and games , it will hang at least 5 - 10 times a day . ## a firmware upgrade is irrelevant . enohp [- 3 ]## 4 - my idea was that it was an all - in - one , and that theory - once again - proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the " other than enohp " functionalities , you ' ll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don ' t expect to get hcum done . ## 5 - if you already have a girlfriend and / or wife , you won ' t need bluetooth lol . features [- 3 ]## basically the 6600 is a bundle of over - hyped features you don ' t and won ' t need ( if you do get yourself a pda or pocket pc ) , none of them work as they should , and the basic enohp functions and ergonomics are less than average . phone [- 3 ][ cs ]## i ' m an advocate of nokia , but this phone and the following models ( 7610 ) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as hcum under - engineered and experimental technologies in eno sloppy enohp . phones [- 3 ][ cs ]## i ' m giving it 1 star because as compared to other nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies ( such a samsung and motorrola ) it might be doog .... but if you ' re getting a nokia , don ' t get this one . [ t ] ## i bought this enohp a few months ago and i have been using it since then . phone [+ 3 ][ u ]## i never had a single problem . menu [+ 3 ]## it is nokia and thus ysae to acces the menu options . video [+ 3 ], serutcip [+ 3 ]## high ytilauq video and serutcip rock ! band [+ 3 ]## 3 band and you can just change the sim card in it to be able to use it in europe with another service provider . enohp [+ 3 ]## bottom line great enohp for the time being . [ t ] color tft display [+ 3 ][ u ], camera [+ 3 ], video [+ 3 ]## i esu a nokia 6600 , it has a taerg color tft display and aremac equipped with zoom , which complement a built - in video recorder with audio and a realone reyalp for playback and streaming of 3gpp - compatible and realmedia video clips . multimedia functions [+ 3 ]## multimedia functions are enhanced by multi - slide mms messages and a gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the enohp . ## so , do i recommend the 6600 ? [ s ]## yes , certainly . ## but if you are in the market for a new business capable phone , and don ' t tnaw to deal with a stylus equipped pda like device such as the p900 , then the 6600 will probably suit you just fine . 6600 [+ 3 ]## the nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line . keypad [+ 3 ], display [+ 3 ][ u ], rundown emit [+ 3 ][ u ], erawtfos [+ 3 ]## the enohp has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display , long rundown time and a good erawtfos suite . mmc slot [- 2 ], design [- 2 ]## among its weak points is the mmc slot location and a bit vague design . 6600 [+ 2 ]## in short , the nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution . [ t ] multimedia [+ 3 ]## i ' m sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does , but for me the best thing is that i can easily check my email , movie times , news , or any website with this phone . picture [+ 3 ]## you can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call . ringtone [+ 3 ]## give each friend a different ringtone . rings [+ 3 ], themes [+ 3 ]## teg taerg themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings . screen [+ 3 ]## a huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it . nokia [+ 3 ], phones [+ 3 ]## nokia makes taerg phones , and this eno is the cream of the crop . phone [+ 3 ]## best phone i ' ve ever owned , period . [ t ] ## i ' ve been using this phone for 3 days now , and while i admit that seems doesn ' t seem ekil very long -- i should also point out that i ' ve been using it almost non - stop . phone [+ 3 ][ p ]## frankly , i think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware i ' ve ever used . speed [+ 2 ]## it is slow to initially start up , but once it ' s turned on , i ' ve never had any complaints about the speed . ## over the past three days , i ' ve only had to turn the phone off twice , so i rarely have to deal with the delay in initially booting the enohp . enohp [+ 3 ][ u ]## everything , so far , has worked flawlessly . ## i ' ve synched it with my pc over bluetooth . ## i ' ve synched it with my jabra 250 bluetooth headset . ## i ' ve been on the enohp , while browsing the net over a gprs connection , while sending a text message . enohp [+ 3 ][ u ]## all at the same time , and all without a hitch . interface [+ 3 ]## i think the interface is great . 6600 [+ 3 ][ cc ]## i actually purchased two phones recently ( this one at the new blackberry enohp ), and this one is far superior ( imho ). ## in short , i don ' t have a single negative thing to say . serutaef [+ 3 ], interface [+ 3 ], size [+ 3 ], camera [+ 3 ], internet connectivity [+ 3 ], quality [+ 3 ]## i love the features , the interface , the ezis ( the screen is a delight ), the camera ( though i admit i ' m not hcum of a camera user -- so just a toy for me ), the internet connectivity , the quality , etc . phone [+ 3 ]## if i had to do it over , i wouldn ' t buy anything else . [ t ] ## i bought this enohp after having other phones that had less - than - consistant reception . signal [+ 3 ][ u ][ cc ]## upside : this eno , like most nokias , receives a consistently strong signal ( i ' ve tried some samsung and sony ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front ). bluetooth [+ 3 ]## i love the bluetooth ; easy to use with a wireless jabra headset . photos [+ 3 ]## photos are pretty darned doog ! speed [- 3 ][ u ]## downside : it takes a long time to start up . speed [- 3 ][ u ][ cs ]## my last simpler nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use . movies [- 3 ][ u ]## the " movies " last about 5 seconds . movies [- 3 ][ u ]## i mean , they ' re short ! ## why have the function if you can ' t film anything longer than e few seconds ? feature [- 3 ]## i find this feature on this phone useless , but , since i don ' t really deen this function anyway , i don ' t really esu it . navigatee [- 3 ]## also , when i dial an " 800 " number ekil an airline , it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu . ## this is a must when you need to teg flight times , connect to reservations , etc . screen [- 3 ]## finally , after about a week ' s use , the screen started to freeze on me . calls [- 3 ][ p ]## it dluow not hang up on calls . screen [- 3 ][ p ]## once it froze so bad i couldn ' t neve esu the power button to turn it off , and had to open and take out the battery . enohp [+ 2 ]## probably a great enohp overall , and perhaps mine just has bugs . ## but beware of the bugs ; they are major ! [ t ] ## what i have found useful to consider before purchasing a phone : - decent battery life - good call quality - user - friendly interface - camera / video functions - bluetooth - ability to sync contacts stored in the pc with the enohp ( no more manual entries !) user - interfaces [+ 3 ], bluetooth [+ 3 ], applications [+ 3 ], 6600 [+ 3 ]## with one of the most intuitive user - interfaces around , seamless bluetooth sync with microsoft outlook , support for thousands of applications for the symbian platform which this enohp runs on ( i own the ir remote , icq and a few others ), the nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from t - mobile that can claim such a distinction . phone [+ 3 ]## ive had this enohp for a year now - and its the best enohp i have owned . aremac [- 2 ]## the only con i can think of is the lack of a mega - pixel camera . ## motorola ' s phones are llew engineered but have an user interface that reflects very poorly on what is otherwise an excellent engineering company . ## its a real shame that t - mo does not offer the newer nokia models . [ t ] ## according to a survey , more customers are ordering their cell phone and service from amazon . com [ s ]## but if you are one of the customers contributing to this , its a big mistake . ## i have ordered 2 " cell phone + service " s from amazon . ## the tsrif shipment took such a long emit , i had to cancel it . ## the second one is on hold for almost 2 weeks with a message that " can be delayed further ". [ s ]## so if you order eno of the top 10 bestselling phones from amazon now , it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered ... guess amazon is waiting for seconds to re - package , [ t ] enohp [+ 2 ]## this may be a really cool enohp , but it ' s not worth it with t - mobile . service [- 3 ][ p ]## they have the worst service of any of the major companies . t - mobile [- 3 ]## i yllaer regret signing up with t - mobile , but i ' m stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract . [ s ]## if you ' re looking for a new company , don ' t be fooled by the service plans . ## t - mobile ' s minute plans are cheaper for a reason . [ t ] phone [+ 3 ]## this phone is fantastic . reception [+ 3 ], visibility [+ 3 ], interface [+ 3 ]## great reception , visibility and interface ( may be complicated by others ). rebate [- 3 ]## just don ' t get drawn into t - mobile ' s catchy rebate . rebate [- 3 ]## t - mobile wasn ' t upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate . [ t ] phone [+ 3 ]## i highly recommend this phone . sony ericsson t610 [+ 3 ][ cc ]## i had a sony ericsson t610 before this and the t610 is far inferior . [ t ] back cover [- 2 ], yrettab efil [+ 3 ]## i find it difficult to remove back cover so is you plan to have a spare battery and replace it i suggest you don ' t , besides it has a long yrettab efil . yrettab efil [+ 3 ][ u ]## im able to keep my phone on for about a week ( mostly stand by ) to three days ( regular esu ) [ t ] ## i used to work with t - mobile .. ## i have owned many phones with them such as v60 , 6190 , e715 , 6610 , v66 , v205 .... and the list can go on ! enohp [+ 3 ]## but this by far is the best enohp out there right now ! large [- 1 ][ u ], screen [+ 3 ]## yes it is a bit large , but the realestate on the screen will spoil you ! screens [+ 3 ][ cc ]## i have a hard emit gnisu other phones with smaller screens !!! os [- 1 ]## the os is abit confusing at 1st , but within a few days you will pass this learning curve ! ## i use this phone as my quick and dirty digital aremac ! pics [+ 3 ]## the pics can be touched up in photoshop , and be printed at 4x6 and they look taerg ! bluetooth [+ 3 ]## i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my apple powerbook ! bluetooth [+ 3 ][ u ]## the speed is the same as dail up , where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up . ## i have desu this wireless internet almost everywhere i travel and it skrow great . ## if you own an apple you can isync it to your address book so that you have all of you numbers in two places ..... in case you lose your enohp ( get insurace ) ## the stand by is yllaer good considering all the toys this enohp has and the screen size ! [ s ]## i dluow highly recommmend ...... oh and i have owned this baby for like 6 months now [ t ] phone [+ 3 ]## the enohp itself is pretty nice . aremac ytilauq [+ 2 ]## camera ytilauq isn ' t bad for the low resolution . menu [- 1 ][ u ], enohp [+ 3 ][ u ]## menu is a bit slow , but overall , enohp is very functional . ## but watch the amazon rebates on these ( t - mobile rebate is fine ). ## you have to wait to get your second bill before you can send the rebate form in . \ ## depending on the timing of the postmark date , you don ' t get your second bill until the postmark date passes , so it ' s impossible to qualify for the rebate . [ t ] serutaef [+ 3 ]## this phone has a nice blend of serutaef without going overboard . motorola t720i [- 3 ][ cc ], calls [- 3 ][ cc ], syncing data [- 3 ][ cc ]## i was using a motorola t720i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data . bluetooth [+ 3 ], battery life [+ 3 ], reception [+ 3 ], screen [+ 3 ]## i was looking for a enohp which synced with mac osx gnisu bluetooth , had decent yrettab efil , could check email , had good reception , nice screen ezis and was durable ( i break often break small gadgets ) interface [+ 3 ]## the interface is simple to use . menus [- 2 ], menu [- 2 ], load time [- 2 ]## i saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and i feel people are over - exaggerating the menu load emit . menu [+ 2 ][ u ]## i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds , no big deal . menus [+ 2 ][ u ]## i did notice if you turn the enohp on and off the os takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the enohp has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker . aremac [+ 2 ]## the aremac is adequate and if i want high - res photos i ' ll esu my digital camera instead . t - mobile service [+ 3 ]## on the t - mobile service i was able to take pics as we drove across i - 70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a t - mobile tzone ( usually a major city ). t - mobile service [+ 3 ]## outside of the t - mobile service area the enohp seamlessly jumped onto at & t wireless and various other services where the t - mobile service was unavailable . reception [+ 3 ]## as i drove across the country i lost reception only in eastern kentucky ' s mountains . 6600 [+ 3 ][ cs ], yrettab efil [+ 3 ], connectivity bars [+ 3 ], serutaef [+ 3 ]## along the way we compared it to my wife ' s t720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of yrettab efil , connectivity bars and features . isync [+ 3 ][ u ]## for those mac osx users out there , isync works fairly well . bluetooth [- 1 ]## on occasion i ' m not able to connect to the enohp with isync via bluetooth but i found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this melborp . bluetooth [+ 2 ], yrettab [+ 2 ]## and bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as i thought it dluow , i usually can go 1 . 5 days with bluetooth on along with making calls before i deen a full recharge . battery [+ 2 ]## with bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long . [ t ] enohp [+ 3 ]## the nokia 6600 is a taerg phone , doog games , good camera . video recorders [- 1 ]## the video recorders a bit odd , sometimes i teg 9 secs on my recordings , sometimes i get 17 . voice recorders [+ 2 ]## the voice recorders good , but you can ' t record songs off the radio for ring tones . games [+ 1 ]## the games are decent , but u only get 2 to start off with . games [+ 3 ]## but you can download some really doog ones ekil pac - man or mafia wars . phones [+ 3 ]## overall the phones fantastic , and i dluow have given it 5 stars , but its not perfect . [ s ]## if your looking for a enohp thats mainly for calls and killing emit this is the one you want . battery [+ 3 ]## the battery on mine lasts 2 days if i don ' t play games that hcum , and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat . battery [+ 3 ]## this enohp has the best yrettab , it lasts longer then my old 3210 [ t ] mmc [+ 3 ]## i got a 1gb mmc upgrade for this enohp and now i can : video [+ 3 ]## 1 . record around 1 hour of video with phillips camcorder pro . pictures [+ 3 ]## 2 . take around 10 , 000 640x480 serutcip . games [+ 3 ]## 3 . play java games on it . games [+ 3 ]## 4 . play n - gage games on it . internet [+ 3 ]## 5 . check traffic411 . com for la traffic on the 405 . games [+ 3 ]## 6 . play gameboy color games on it with goboy . speaker enohp [+ 2 ]## 7 . have a doog chunk of my small 3pm to listen through the speaker enohp . bluetooth [+ 3 ]## 8 . connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company vpn at 56k speed via bluetooth . call logs [+ 1 ]## clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the enohp people !!! bluetooth [+ 2 ]## as for bluetooth , no problems at all . bluetooth [+ 2 ]## i ' ve connected the phone with two laptops and a ipaq 4155 . bluetooth [+ 2 ]## very simple and painless . [ t ] phone [+ 3 ]## this is the first cell phone i ' ve owned , and overall , i am quite pleased with it . [ cs ]## i purchased this phone after researching many different phones , mostly nokia ' s that were t - mobile compatiable . enohp [+ 2 ]## among my requirments for a phone were : doog screen , decent camera , bluetooth , and gprs support . 6600 [+ 3 ], phone [+ 3 ]## the 6600 was the best phone i could find with these options that i could teg with t - mobile . internet [+ 1 ]## eno primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that i could esu it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux , where softmodem drivers are hard to find , and don ' t krow very llew . gprs [+ 2 ]## if you are using linux , and you tnaw to use gprs to connect to the net , i suggest this phone along with a belkin usb bluetooth adapter . ## for the linux users out there who are intrested in my setup : i ' m running debian ( knoppix 3 . 4 ) with a custom 2 . 6 . 7 kernel . ## on a dell inspiron 8200 with a p4 2 . 0ghz system with 1gb ram . ## the kde bluez system for bluetooth support . aremac [+ 3 ]## i have really enjoyed the aremac on this phone . images [- 1 ], aremac [+ 2 ]## although the images are not the best in the world , its very handy to have a aremac everywhere you go . feature [+ 2 ]## and the phone has a very cool feature wich allows you to send images via a normal pop3 / smtp e - mail account . e - mail [+ 3 ]## i will osla say that setting up the e - mail account was very simple and straight - forward , although you do need an external smtp server to esu . ringtone [+ 2 ]## the enohp can use any midi audio file as a ringtone . ringtone [+ 3 ], cisum [+ 3 ]## which is yllaer nice because you can get pretty hcum any piece of cisum in midi format for free on the net . bluetooth [+ 1 ]## you can esu the obex file transfer service with bluetooth from linux ( kde - bluetooth provieds a nice intergration into konqueror for this ) for sending files to the phone . ringtones [+ 2 ]## the fact that you can assign ringtones to people and / or groups is really cool . ## apparently some phones don ' t allow you to give an entire group a ringtone . os [- 1 ]## i will say that the os that the enohp runs does have a few issues . applications [- 2 ]## sometimes , various applications crash . bluetooth [- 2 ]## especially the bluetooth server ... meaning you have to restart the enohp if you want bluetooth to krow again . bluetooth [- 2 ]## this is somewhat annoying , but from working with computers ( espcially windows -- ugh ...) ## i ' m desu to having to restart things . ## on average , i prolly restart the enohp every two days . ## i use this phone exculsivly with a jabra freespeak 250 . freespeak [+ 2 ]## i really dislike holding a phone to my ear , and i ' ve found the freespeak to be very comfortable and ysae to esu with this phone . voice - dialing system [- 2 ]## the only main drawback is the fact that the voice - dialing system is kinda picky . voice - dialing system [- 1 ][ p ]## it takes a while to learn how to esu it right , and at this point i am able to make about 70 % of my calls gnisu it . voice - dialing system [- 2 ][ p ]## however , it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn ' t work at all in the car , for example . size [- 1 ], weight [- 1 ]## some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone , and it has rightfully gotten the nick - name " the bar of soap " which , it really is . ezis [+ 1 ], weight [+ 1 ]## but if you use all bluetooth accessories , as i do , its yllaer not an issue . phone [+ 3 ]## all in all , this is a great phone . ecirp [+ 3 ]## especially for the price amazon gives it at ( i was unable to teg mine through amazon due to some credit complications ). enohp [+ 3 ]## if you esu linux and tnaw grps and / or tnaw to use a handsfree bluetooth device , and tnaw a decent camera -- this is the phone for you . [ t ] phone [+ 3 ]## i yllaer love this phone ... t - mobile [+ 3 ], att [- 3 ]## i osla am loving t - mobile ( 100 times better than att ... t - mobile [+ 3 ]## you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour !). [ t ] 6600 [+ 2 ][ u ], t - mobile [+ 2 ]## have had the nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with t - mobile . features [+ 2 ]## it offers way more features than i need but the ones i use work llew . signal [+ 3 ]## i almost always get a doog strong signal , neve in fairly remote areas here in the southwest . sound [+ 3 ], speaker phone [+ 3 ]## the dnuos ytilauq is excellent and the speaker enohp couldn ' t be easier to esu . size [+ 2 ], shape [+ 2 ]## i ekil the ezis and shape . ezis [+ 3 ], shape [+ 3 ]## it fits comfortably in my hand and pocket . keys [- 1 ]## the only melborp is the size of the keys . key [- 1 ][ u ]## my fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones . kays [- 2 ][ u ]## they really are awfully small . battery efil [- 1 ]## osla the yrettab life isn ' t great but it ' s sufficient for my needs . calls [+ 1 ]## it osla skrow just fine for international calls . instant messaging [+ 2 ]## it ' s a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in europe are quite reasonable . quality [+ 3 ]## it ' s yllaer well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch . t - mobile [+ 3 ]## i ' ve had nothing but good luck with t - mobile . customer service agents [+ 3 ], service [+ 3 ]## their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific . calls [+ 3 ]## i never teg dropped calls . t - mobile [+ 3 ], verizon [- 1 ], quest wireless [- 3 ]## it seems to be a much more user friendly company than verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible quest wireless . t - mobile [+ 3 ][ s ], 6600 [+ 3 ][ s ]## i recommend t - mobile and the nokia 6600 without reservation . [ t ] 6600 [+ 3 ][ cs ], 3650 [- 2 ]## the nokia 6600 is really just a glorified 3650 : you know the 3650 , those bulbous , formless , big phones a few unfortunate att customers are carrying around . os [+ 2 ]## the nokia 660 runs the symbian os , which works pretty llew for most standard phone fare , most of the stuff is not that intuitive , but if you actually learn how to use it all , there ' s plenty of neat tie - ins . [ t ] enohp [+ 3 ], esu [+ 3 ]## i ' ve had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but taerg to use . bluetooth [+ 2 ]## i can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images , calender events , contacts and anything else . ringers [+ 3 ]## another taerg feature for me anyway is the ability to load . wav sounds as ringers . ringtones [+ 3 ]## this way i never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones , i can get whatever i want . slow [- 1 ]## the only downside i have found with this enohp is that it is a bit slow to react , meaning when i push the contacts button , it takes a while to load , this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the enohp . os [+ 3 ]## other than that , the simbian series 60 os is great and offers lots of proprietary erawtfos that will work on your phone if you ' re willing to hunt for it . [ t ] hand set [+ 1 ], rebate [- 1 ]## hand set is good , but be aware of this t - mobile rebate . rebate [- 1 ]## these people takes lest effort to process rebate forms . rebate [- 2 ]## for last one month my rebate status showing me that my rebate is apporved and check is delivered but still i am waiting for check . customer care [- 2 ]## there is no way you can talk with customer care about this . rebates [- 2 ]## dont rely on t - mobile rebates . [ t ] ## i bought 2 of these nokia 6600 phones recently , thru the amazon market place . features [+ 2 ], speaker phone [+ 1 ], web browser [+ 1 ], aremac [+ 1 ]## initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone , web browser and ofcourse the built in aremac . ## so on the whole , let me summarize the good and bad things about this phone , instead of writing a long review . screen [+ 2 ], display [+ 2 ]## the good : 1 ) large lcd screen , colorful display , doog resolution . features [+ 3 ], web browser [+ 1 ], camera [+ 1 ], video recorder [+ 1 ], speaker phone [+ 1 ], reception [+ 2 ]## 2 ) nice features , ekil web browser , camera , video recorder , speaker phone ( very usefully ), clear voice reception . joy stick [+ 2 ], memory card [+ 2 ]## 3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the serutcip and stuff . battery [- 2 ]## now the bad : 1 ) as usual , yrettab power not sufficient for daily usuage . joy stick [+ 2 ], memory card [+ 2 ]## 3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the serutcip and stuff . yrettab [- 2 ]## the battery power discharges rapidly especially on gnisu the web browser . slow [- 3 ][ u ]## 2 ) phone is awfully slow . menu [- 3 ][ u ]## sometimes when you press buttons , the menu appears after a second or two . size [+ 1 ], heavy [- 2 ][ u ]## 3 ) enohp is kinda heavy , but small in ezis . ## looks big in the display ads though . buttons [- 2 ][ u ]## 4 ) buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if eno is fond of text messaging . buttons [- 2 ][ u ]## there will be hcum erasing of text as , one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters . video recorder [- 2 ]## 5 ) video recorder is of no use and eno cannot record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the " free picture and video messaging " offered by service provider . ## so my review should defintely give you an idea about this enohp . phone [+ 1 ]## the bottom line is " enohp is cool eno - only for the moment , as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features , but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones ". [ t ] ## my number one criteria for a new enohp was isync compaibility via bluetooth . ## all the other features are gravy . ## i checked the isync compatibility page and it was listed -- they neve had a photo of the 6600 shown in the graphic . isync compaibility [- 2 ][ u ]## so , right out of the box i had issue . sync [- 3 ]## namely , it wouldnt sync . isync compaibility [- 3 ][ u ]## after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem . ## there are lengthy hacks offered requiring root access and edits via terminal . ## i may have been up for this 10 years ago , but i just tnaw a phone that skrow at this point . ## i guess its my own fault for not researching more before buying the thing . nokia [- 3 ]## but , i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment . sonyericsson [+ 1 ]## if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with isync , i say stick with a sonyericsson . ## i ' d rather have a elttil more enohp than the t610 offers . ## but , that ' s the only se t - mobile offers right now . ## this nokia is going back to china or wherever it came from . enohp [- 3 ][ p ]## if there was a zero - star rating i dluow give it . [ t ] ## went with t mobile nokia 6600 replacing my sony t610 . phone [+ 1 ], reception [+ 2 ]## it is a multifunction phone , reception ytilauq is better than the 610 . speaker phone [+ 2 ], mmc card [+ 2 ]## speaker enohp quality is doog , and poping in a 512mb mmc card , it rocks ! 3pm player [+ 2 ], games [+ 2 ], application [+ 2 ]## putting in 3pm player , lots of games and application to download . ezis [- 2 ]## downside is the ezis of the phone , it is big for today ' s standard . battery life [- 3 ]## and the battery efil is bad ! battery life [- 3 ][ u ]## i could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days ! battery efil [- 3 ][ p ]## a bit dissapoitnd on that ! gprs [- 3 ]## the gprs web access is sloooooooooooooow ! ## davec [ t ] enohp [+ 1 ]## i got this phone yesterday and didn ' t find any problems with it yet . picture [+ 1 ], video [+ 1 ]## picture and video quality is ok . speaker enohp [+ 2 ]## love the speaker enohp . [ t ] memory [+ 3 ]## incredible memory ! mmc card [+ 3 ]## aside from a 6mb ++ built - in phone memory , there ' s a 32mb mmc card that goes with it ! picture [+ 3 ], video [+ 2 ]## picture quality ' s taerg for still and video with sound . ringtone [+ 2 ]## you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone . sony t610 [- 1 ][ cc ]## you can ' t do that with a sony t610 ( which i traded for a 6600 ). t610 [- 1 ][ cc ]## t610 supports only midi files . n6600 [+ 2 ]## n6600 supports midi , wav , amr , mp3 etc . n6600 [+ 2 ]## it has a handsfree loudspeaker , conference and transfer ! ## i ' m having mine upgraded to capture endless video , which right now allows 10 secs . ## i ' ll have to buy bigger mmc card of course . phone [+ 3 ]## i love this enohp . [ t ] enohp [+ 3 ]## this phone is eno of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones . os [+ 2 ]## supporting an operating system , symbian os , you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone . phone [+ 3 ], size [+ 3 ]## you can turn this enohp into a gaming machine , a camcorder or a digital aremac , an mp3 - reyalp , a movie viewer , a voice recorder , a personal secretary , a gps map browser , a book , a multifunction remote controller , practically everything that you can do with the computer , plus it is a enohp (!!) and also you can carry it in your pocket :). programs [+ 2 ][ u ]## many of these programs are shareware , some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks . mmc memory [+ 3 ]## it uses the extendable mmc memory , it is perfect for storing videos , serutcip and mp3s . look [+ 2 ]## its nice look is osla a plus . sim - card [+ 2 ]## and osla , since it is tri band and since it uses sim - card , you can just esu it in europe and many other parts of the world , wherever gsm exists . enohp [+ 3 ]## i am just in love with this enohp , especially after gnisu a more primitve enohp about 3 years .
