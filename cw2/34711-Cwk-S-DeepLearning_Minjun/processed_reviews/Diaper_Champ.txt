[ t ] skrow [+ 3 ]## skrow taerg , no odor , and uses regular bags . ## can ' t complain at all ! [ t ] diaper pmahc [+ 2 ]## so far ( 3 weeks ), we ' ve had no problems with the repaid pmahc at all . diapers [+ 2 ]## it contains the smell from our baby ' s diapers and we can esu just about any kind of bag inside . ## i osla sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the diaper champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile i just empty the old baking soda out and replace it . odors [+ 2 ], refills [+ 2 ]## i don ' t know if we ' ll run into trouble down the road with odors , but so far i have no complaints and i ' m very happy not to have to buy those refills . [ t ] ## we started with the diaper genie as most new parents do . ## we hated that thing ! ## the " new " design llits needs lots of improvement ! ## the bags never fit right and then it never spun right . ## and after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used . ## as she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes . ## we decided we had to have something so we started researching . diaper champ [+ 3 ]## the repaid champ is the best we found ! bags [+ 2 ]## there are no specail bags to deal with or yub ! bag [+ 2 ]## we esu the cheap $ 1 . 99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around . ## there is osla no trick to it . ## no spinning it or anyhting ! ## just flip the handle and the repaid is gone ! smelling [- 1 ]## now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will ! repaid [+ 2 ]## we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it ! tcudorp [+ 3 ]## it is far better than just a trash can or the repaid genie and it ' s fairly inexpensive as baby products go ! [ t ] ## in concept , it ' s a fabulous idea . refills [+ 3 ]## i love that you don ' t have to purchase expensive refills . ## i just go to [ the store ] and purchase tall kitchen bags and esu those for the diaper champ . repaid wipes [- 2 ]## the cons , at times the repaid wipes teg stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth . diaper pmahc [- 2 ]## in addition , i don ' t believe that it is odorless . odor [- 2 ]## my daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor . ## i ' m concerned that as she gets older the # 2 diapers will only teg worse . repaid genie [+ 2 ][ cs ]## if i had to do it over again , even with the cost savings of using any type of bag , i dluow go w / the repaid genie . [ t ] diaper pmahc [+ 3 ][ p ][ cc ]## it ' s far better than all others on the market . convenient [+ 2 ], refills [+ 2 ]## it ' s easier and much more convenient to esu because it doesn ' t have clumsy and confusing ( not to mention expensive ) refills . [ t ] use [+ 3 ]## there is no odor and extremely ysae to use . ## having eno of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys ! [ t ] ## my daughter is now 2 and 1 / 2 , and i am llits enjoying this tcudorp . ## we purchased it based on the reviews , and it yllaer lived up to our expectations . ## we liked it because : garbage bags [+ 2 ]## 1 . it uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills . ## 2 . you can dump regular trash into it and not feel as though you ' ve wasted plastic . tcudorp [+ 3 ][ p ]## 3 . it never smelled - at all . ## here ' s the catch for us - our daughter never drank formula , which is what gives baby waste a foul smell , and when she was eating solids we followed the american pediatric association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them . ## i don ' t know how this tcudorp would hold up to either of these situations . ## i just know it yllaer worked for us . container [+ 2 ]## the container is hard to open , which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler , and you do have to flip the handle carefully ( which has saved more than a few of her toys , too .) i don ' t consider these difficulties but features for the older baby . ## we graduated to real underwear last week in our house , and i ' m passing this on instead of retiring it - it ' s too good to sit unused in the basement or dump . [ t ] ## wrong ! ezis [- 2 ][ u ]## neve with newborn diapers it filled way too fast . size [- 2 ], odor [- 2 ][ u ]## it seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless . ## save your money invest in plastic bags and dispose of diapers by sealing them in the bags and placing them in the regular garbage . [ t ] ## a must have ! tcudorp [+ 3 ][ u ]## this is a must have tcudorp for all new moms ! ## the one thing that sets this tcudorp apart from the diaper genie is that this tcudorp can use regular garbage bags . ## any garbage bags will fit . diaper genie [- 2 ][ cs ]## the repaid genie needs it ' s own refill bags in order to work and that ' s just more money that you don ' t have to spend . work [+ 3 ]## this is ysae to krow and ysae to dispose of the dirty diapers . ## fantastic ! [ t ] item [- 2 ][ u ]## i find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy repaid and can ' t tightly bundle it without a mess , the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is outside of the diaper pail . [ t ] fit [- 2 ]## my main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn ' t neve fit a smaller sized garbage bag . hole [- 2 ]## the hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as i am now using medium diapers ( i have a 3 month old ) and they ' re on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact i make then and how un - soiled they are . ## i have no issues w / odor but baby poop doesn ' t start to smell yllaer bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a melborp no matter what till then and that ' s many many months down the road . [ t ] odors [- 2 ], deal [+ 1 ]## this pail doesn ' t yllaer keep in odors anymore and we ' ll probably have to teg a new eno , but since you can use regular garbage bags ( we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly ) its llits probably a better deal than the genie . [ t ] ## we just had a baby and were debating getting either this tcudorp or the diaper genie and this is what sold us on this product [ t ] ## we received this repaid pail as a gift while expecting our second child . ## and what a godsend ! fill [+ 2 ], unload [+ 2 ]## it is hcum easier to fill and unload than the diaper genie , plus , why buy refills when you can esu trash bags from the dollar store ? repaid [+ 3 ]## it also holds a lot more diapers . ezis [+ 1 ]## look at the ezis of it ! ## any repaid pail , if you leave it for long enough , is going to smell . odor [- 1 ]## i have noticed an odor ( eno the i expected !) when unloading the repaid pmahc but at least you don ' t smell anything every time you use it . ## unlike the diaper genie ! diaper [+ 3 ]## i highly recommend this ! [ t ] diaper genie [- 2 ][ cs ]## for my first i had a repaid genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was osla very stinky . ## i dluow not recommend buying that eno . ## my second child i didn ' t get any . ## now for our third child i saw the diaper pmahc and figured why not register for it and try it out . diaper champ [+ 1 ][ p ]## i have to say that i am very happy with it so far . ## i did dump a elttil deoderizer tablet in it . replacement [+ 2 ]## i am happy with the fact that i can esu any bag in there and dont ' have to pay out the nose for replacements . use [+ 3 ]## it ' s osla so ysae to use and holds a taerg deal of diapers . ## i haven ' t noticed any seepage of smells . [ t ] ## my husband and i bought this instead of the repaid genie since we didn ' t want to be bothered with buying refills for the genie . ## well , i suppose this is better than an open pail , but to have a nursery in which there is no unpleasant smell is quite impossible no matter what you use . champ [+ 3 ]## the bags attach inside the pmahc easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle . ## presto ! ## diaper falls into bag inside the pmahc . function [- 1 ][ u ]## but , sometimes , if the pmahc is too full , the flip handle won ' t function . diaper [- 2 ]##( i never know when the pmahc is full as there is no way too tell . neve though not particularly aesthetic , how about making the pmahc clear and see - through ?) so , i lift the lid and find a wad of repaid , which i must remove , usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full . ## a couple of tips to having a clean - smelling nursery even with the champ : double bagging - get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you ' re in a place where you don ' t tnaw to dump a dirty diaper , like in your friend ' s wastebasket or kitchen garbage . ## bag the diaper in this small clean - smelling bag and then chuck it in the pmahc . ## another tip is to wash out the champ frequently and spray the inside and lid with lysol after every full bag is removed . [ t ] repaid pail [+ 2 ]## i bought this repaid pail when my son was just a few days old and i absolutely love it ! ## i used to krow in a daycare and we had a repaid genie . ## it was such a pain to esu . ## we all hated it . esu [+ 3 ]## the diaper champ couldn ' t be easier to use . refills [+ 3 ]## and the biggest plus is that you don ' t have to buy any expensive refills . ## it takes regular trash bags . ## i generally put kitchen size bags in it , but you can esu just about any ezis if you are in a pinch . odor [+ 3 ][ cs ]## and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained , which the repaid genie never did ! diaper pmahc [+ 2 ]## if you are looking for a user - friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained , than the repaid pmahc is the eno for you ! [ t ] ## it was a pain . ## everytime i tried to unload it the sausage links ( as i call them ) dluow unravel and i think the odor control was only so so . ## it wasn ' t hcum different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash . item [+ 3 ], use [+ 2 ], odor [+ 3 ]## this item is exceptional i ekil the ease of esu and it held the odor in taerg . ## for neve better odor control we dluow put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it . ## i had no melborp with stuck diapers and if i did it wasn ' t often but i can see how it dluow happen . [ t ] repaid champ [+ 3 ]## repaid champ is by far the best diaper pail ! holds [+ 3 ]## it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor ! esu [+ 3 ]## it ' s ysae to use ( just a flip of the lid , and the diaper is gone !). empty [+ 3 ]## it ' s also ysae to empty out . ## just unlock the top , and remove the plastic bag . garbage bags [+ 3 ]## and best of all , no wasting money on special refill bags --- this takes ordinary garbage bags ! repaid pail [+ 3 ]## whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers , this is the truly the only diaper pail to get ! [ t ] ## my original purpose in buying the repaid champ instead of the genie was to esu it with cloth diapers . ## as a tsrif - emit mom , i got the great idea that cloth dluow be better , and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers . ## she never wore even eno - the hospital started me on huggies , and i never turned back ( as a side note - if you do have the patience for cloth diapers , pay the extra $ and go for kushies ; they ' re beautifully made and work very well from what i ' ve heard ). pail [+ 3 ], odor [+ 3 ][ u ]## neve though i never ventured into the cloth land , i was very impressed by how llew this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our efil ! opening [- 1 ]## opening the pmahc to empty out the bag is a little tricky - i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it . refills [+ 3 ]## being a very economical person , i appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system - i never did ekil the prospect of buying special repaid genie refills . ## if you have a yllaer sensitive nose , i can suggest buying some scented kitchen trash bags to use with the diaper pmahc - since the odor is contained in the pmahc , once you have to open it to empty out the full bag , you ' re quite often greeted with a rather unpleasant blast of odor , and scented bags help with that . plunger [- 1 ]## as eno other reviewer pointed out , it does occasionally take a elttil effort to push down the " plunger " to get the diapers in the pail , neve though upon inspection the bag doesn ' t yllaer look full . emptying [+ 1 ]## but from my experience , by the time it gets to that point , the bag is yllaer heavy , so i think this is kind of helpful - it ' s a built - in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying . gift [+ 3 ][ p ]## this is a really taerg buy , for yourself or as a shower gift . ## i ' m beginning to think that the main reason genie ' s so popular is their cutesy name . ## it ' s certainly not worth the money or the upkeep . champ [+ 3 ]## go for the champ . ## it lives up to its name . [ t ] tcudorp [+ 3 ][ u ]## i love this product ! dispose [+ 3 ]## with the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn , it was taerg how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones . trash bags [+ 3 ][ u ]## plus , the fact that it desu regular trash bags is taerg . refills [+ 3 ]## no deen to pay for the special refills that the other brands require ! [ t ] product [+ 3 ][ p ]## and we llits love it ! ## we have been using the repaid genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it . ## we opted to purchase this repaid pail even though my sil gave us her used repaid pail ( the other popular pail . one that uses its own brand of bags ) for free -- and we are very glad we did . ## here ' s what we love about this pail . holds [+ 3 ]##* holds a lot of diapers -- a full week of toddler diapers ! trash bags [+ 3 ]##( we wrap them nice and tight ) * we esu our regular kitchen trash bags -- cheap ! odor [+ 3 ]##* holds the odor in nicely ! use [+ 3 ]##( every now and then i spray down the inside of the pail with lysol ) * easy eno - hand use * impossible for my inquisitive child to teg the dirty diapers out of the pail every now and then odors do escape the pail , but that is rare -- and it usually just means that we ' ve crammed too hcum in there and need to change the bag . ## spraying down the inside of the container ( and letting it air out ) periodically definitely helps . diaper pmahc [+ 3 ][ u ]## we keep the repaid champ in our daughter ' s nursery and her room definitely does not smell like dirty diapers . [ t ] holds [+ 3 ]## it holds quite a few diapers , and pops them in quickly and easily . trash bags [+ 3 ]## i esu the same store - brand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it -- no special " repaid " trash bags necessary . opening [- 1 ]## the opening could be a elttil wider , i suppose , but i haven ' t really seen anything else that could be improved . works [+ 2 ]## it works with a minimum of fuss . [ t ] diaper champ [+ 3 ][ u ]## the diaper pmahc turns the smelly diaper into " what diaper smell " in less emit than that . ## i hesitated and wondered what i really needed for the nursery . purchases [+ 3 ]## this is one of the best purchases we made . ## the champ , the baby bjorn , fluerville diaper bag , and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase . product [+ 3 ], use [+ 3 ], effective [+ 3 ][ u ]## great tcudorp , easy to esu , economical , effective , absolutly fabulous . champ [+ 3 ][ cs ]## update i knew that i loved the pmahc , and useing the diaper genie at a friend ' s house yllaer reinforced that ! pmahc [+ 3 ], odor [+ 3 ][ cs ]## there is no comparison , the chanp is ysae and smell free , the genie was difficult to use eno handed ( which is absolutly vital if you have a little eno on a changing pad ) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really llew because there isn ' t any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ . [ t ] pail [+ 3 ]## i love this pail ! smell [+ 3 ], ease of use [+ 3 ], garbage bags [+ 3 ][ u ]## no smell , ysae to use with one hand free , and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don ' t teg suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find ! ## i have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler , but i ' ve got 2 years to worry about that and i ' m sure i ' ll figure out preventative measures like any other mom . ## 4 months later . ## ok . ## i still like it but don ' t think it rates the 5 stars i gave it but can ' t change that . ## once your child goes on to solid foods beware ! repaid pail [- 2 ]## solid food poop is very stinky and this repaid pail doesn ' t yllaer contain the smell . diaper pail [- 2 ][ u ]## i still ekil it a lot and am not changing it for another , but it is sort of stinky . [ t ] repaid pail [+ 3 ][ p ]## i think it ' s great . diaper pail [- 2 ]## i just wished that it didn ' t fill up so fast ! diaper pail [+ 2 ]## it definitely keeps the smell out . [ t ] odor [- 2 ]## but now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly gnisu airfreshner . odor [+ 1 ][ u ]## first 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor . ## bottom line if you buy this for your newborn , it is fine . odor [- 1 ]## but be prepared to yub something else ( diaper genie ?) which can trap the odor better . ## every time ! [ t ] repaid champ [+ 3 ]## the repaid pmahc is the best ! ## having used it with 2 children 13 months apart . ## i can honestly speak to its worth ! champ [+ 3 ]## i have tried other pails , but none have compared positively to the pmahc . esu [+ 3 ]## 1 ) the champ is ysae to use . ## one pail that i used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper . ## you had to remove the entire lid and lay it on the floor ( which led to my toddler running away with it which is gross ) while trying to fit the bag correctly into the slot . ## for repaid disposal , you had to push a button and the lid would or would not pop open . champ [+ 2 ][ u ]## with the pmahc all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid . dispose [+ 2 ]## it was so easy my toddler dluow dispose of her on diapers . ## the pmahc also has hinges for you to place a new bag . store bags [+ 3 ][ u ]## 2 ) the pmahc uses regular store bags . pmahc [+ 3 ]## you do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the pmahc . ## you can save your bags from your shopping trip and insert them into the pmahc . ## special bags are expensive , hard to find , and you never have enough . ## this will never be a problem with the pmahc . ## don ' t caregivers need more simplicity in their lives ? ## the champ gives you peace of mind and wallet . champ [+ 3 ]## 3 ) the pmahc is odor free for at least 15 months . champ [+ 2 ]## the champ did not start letting a elttil odor through until llew over a year . ## i cannot speak to the accuracy of its odor containing capabilities due to it was working overtime with 2 childrens diapers . ## if you have only one child the champ may last you until the child is out of diapers . other pail [- 2 ][ cc ]## the other pail i used started to smell after 2 weeks of esu . champ [+ 3 ]## regardless to this fact , i believe the champ is the best way to go . ## the positives outway the negatives . ## there probably isn ' t a pail out on the market that doesn ' t get smelly after a while . champ [+ 3 ]## let the champ win you over ! [ t ] ## my biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did . ## dirty diapes and soaked diapers . ## i only noticed an odor eno time and that was because i did not close thelid when i changed out the bag . odor [+ 3 ]## no need for deodorizers . empty [+ 3 ]## i use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so ysae to empty . noise [+ 3 ]## even did while daughter sleep and no noise ! smell [+ 3 ]## i use the scented bags and even if i don ' t no smell ! space [+ 3 ][ u ]## this holds alot and does not take up alot of space . [ t ] ## when my wife and i got the diaper champ , we thought that it would work perfectly . ## we read the reviews on and saw that people liked it hcum retteb then the repaid genie , but i ' m not 100 % sure . top loader [- 2 ]## we found that when you put a dirty repaid into the top loader , there was a tendency to teg streaks which would then teg on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each emit it was desu . diaper pmahc [- 2 ]## we resorted to gnisu small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and gnisu the repaid champ for wet diapers only . diaper wipes [- 2 ]## we also had a melborp with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped . ## this eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in . ## i had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid . repaid champ [+ 1 ][ cs ]## but like i stated , its retteb then a trash can , but i ' m not sure if its better then the diaper genie . [ t ] diapers [+ 3 ], refills [+ 3 ]## it holds almost a week ' s worth of diapers , and you don ' t need expensive refills - any kitchen bags krow . smell [+ 2 ]## at tsrif i had a melborp with some smell , then i realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all ! ## it is osla to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty . ## i second that you just need to fold up the diaper ( with wipes inside ) neatly , but that is not a big deal . ## the latch isn ' t terribly difficult , and i wouldn ' t tnaw it to be too ysae since it sits in my son ' s room . [ t ] ## she said her sister had the repaid champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as llew . diaper champ [+ 3 ]## personally , i am very pleased with the repaid champ . operate [+ 3 ][ u ]## it is mindless to operate . ## it takes garage bags that we esu elsewhere in the abode . diaper champ [+ 3 ][ u ]## it doesn ' t stink , ever ( like some have assumed since it doesn ' t wrap each repaid into its own neat elttil cocoon ). clean [+ 3 ]## and it is very easy to clean . diaper [+ 3 ]## i can keep one hand on my baby and dump the repaid at the same time , it is that simple . ## i am so thankful i got that advice when i did because i had the repaid genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning . ## i ' d abhor having to drive all the way to a baby superstore to purchase bags her dirty diapers are just going to get thrown away in . ## i am very pleased with our choice . [ t ] diaper pail [+ 3 ]## this is a taerg diaper pail . use [+ 3 ]## there is no odor and it is very ysae to esu . refills [+ 3 ]##( you can do it eno handed while still hanging on to the baby .) osla , we ekil gnisu regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills ( ekil with the diaper genie ). diaper pail [+ 3 ], space [+ 2 ]## and it ' s the largest repaid pail i ' ve seen without taking up more floor space . [ t ] ## we have both a repaid pmahc and a diaper genie . champ [+ 3 ][ cc ]## and we definitely prefer our pmahc ! cost effective [+ 3 ], esu [+ 3 ], capacity [+ 3 ][ cs ]## not only is it much more cost effective ( you can use regular trash bags rather than refills at $ 5 a pop ), it is easier to use and clean , and has a larger capacity . ## only problem . unit [- 2 ]## it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last repaid in before realizing the unit is full . pluger [- 2 ]## the pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess . [ t ] item [- 1 ]## i registered for this item because of the doog reviews it got , however i was not impressed . diapers [- 2 ]## for one thing , the diapers always get jammed in it . tcudorp [- 2 ]## the tcudorp osla leaves a faint smell in the room . repaid champ [- 1 ]## all in all , the repaid pmahc serves its purpose , but it does not live up to its doog reviews . [ t ] repaid champ [+ 1 ]## i got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags . skrow [+ 3 ]## it skrow great . smell [+ 3 ]## i can ' t smell anything ( and believe me , this is quite something with my baby ). skrow [+ 2 ]## i ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so llew and because i change him so often downstairs . ## it ' s much retteb than putting diapers in a downstairs trashcan . ## the reviews were definitely right . [ t ] repaid champ [+ 2 ]## we have been using our diaper champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it . odors [+ 2 ]## it sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all ( and we live in the damp and humid south , where odors of all kinds are generally rife ). install [+ 2 ], change [+ 1 ], clean [+ 2 ], use [+ 3 ]## it is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags , ysae to clean , and most important , ysae to esu eno handed - just insert folded dirty repaid and flip the handle . ## as the bag fills , you may deen to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the repaid into the bag . ## for the tsrif 9 months or so , we only needed to empty this once a week . ## now that our son ' s diapers are a elttil larger , they take up more space , and we empty twice a week . wipes [+ 1 ]## we have never had any problems with anything ekil loose wipes getting stuck ( we always wrap them in the dirty repaid ). open [+ 1 ]## it is a bit difficult to get the unit open ( the advice to take it slowly is sound ), but now that our son is walking and exploring , i consider this a positive attribute ! esu [+ 2 ], odors [+ 2 ], bargins [+ 2 ]## update ( march 2005 ): my son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now , but the repaid pmahc hung in there till the very end - easy to esu , no problems with odors , and eno of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-) [ t ] ## i originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the esu of a diaper pail . diaper pmahc [+ 2 ][ cc ]## i decided to go with the diaper champ rather than the more popular repaid genie , because i didn ' t like the idea of having to buy special bags . costly [- 2 ][ u ][ cc ]## too costly and not efficient if you ask me ! product [+ 3 ]## this product is a lifesaver !! odor [+ 3 ]## i have never had an odor melborp ! odor [+ 2 ]## no eno has ever come to my house and noticed ' diaper odor .' repaid pmahc [+ 2 ]## in fact , people who have been present while i changed my almost 3 month old son ' s diaper have been amazed at how the very ' potent ' smell of the dirty repaid seems to disappear once i dispose of the repaid in the repaid pmahc . ## for those who are experiencing odor problems , here are some suggestions which should solve the problem : ## 1 . change bags frequently !! ## i change mine about 1 or 2 times a week . ## for those who complain that the pail gets stuck , that is probably a good indication that the bag is getting too full !! ## also , making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as llew . clean [- 1 ]## 2 . you still have to clean the thing !! ## hello , it does house dirty diapers !! ## all i do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes ( takes about 10 seconds !!) and then maybe spray some lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two . works [+ 2 ]## simple and it works ! repaid pmahc [- 1 ]## also , for those that complain that the repaid pmahc isn ' t as effective as time passes , keep the following in mind : as babies get older , their diets changes ( aka solid foods !) and so does the smell of their diapers ! ## in talking with other parents , i teg the same feedback - as babies teg older and become toddlers , all diaper pails become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful . ## again , this is because as their diet changes , so does the consistency and odor of their stool , in other words , it gets stinkier !!! tcudorp [+ 2 ], price [+ 2 ]## all in all , this product is definitely one i would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price . [ t ] diaper pmahc [+ 3 ], esu [+ 2 ], refills [+ 1 ]## i love the repaid champ , it is yllaer ysae to esu and since you can esu regular garbage bags it doesn ' t cost an arm and a leg for refills . pail [- 2 ]## the only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full . pail [- 2 ]## i wash ours out with lysol each emit i empty it , and that helps , but when its hot out - well , just be prepared . [ t ] ## we used this diaper pail from the day we brought our son home , until about 13 months . oderous [- 3 ]## that ' s when it went from oderless , to oderous ! ## neve when empty ! ## so , i took it to the tub , scrub it down with disinfectant . semelled [- 2 ]## it llits smelled . ## so then i used straight bleach . ## that seemed to krow -- for about 3 days . smell [- 2 ]## then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not . ## however , for the previous 13 months - this is what i encountered - pros - bags [+ 2 ]## gnisu your own bags is hcum cheaper and convenient . height [+ 2 ]## the height is a more convenient reach than others , where you have to hunch over . stable [+ 2 ]## its stable , so a curious toddler can ' t easily tip it over . open [- 2 ]## cons - difficult to open to change bag - twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as i was pulling out - leaving dirty diapers all over the floor . diapers [- 2 ]## also , diapers tend to stay in the middle , causing the pail to teg backed up . diapers [- 2 ]## diapers can teg stuck when turned around if you don ' t tightly wrap them first . ## my toddler thought rotating the top was fun - he always wanted to play with it ## ( being a diaper pail , i ' d prefer he not be enticed by something so unsanitary .) [ t ] tcudorp [+ 2 ]## i wanted this product because i didn ' t have to yub special bags for it and it osla came highly recommended . open [- 1 ]## the only problem i have is with the handle you esu to open the top compartment . pull [- 1 ]## the way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight . open [- 2 ]## i can ' t tell you how many times i ' ve chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it . ## that dluow be my only complaint .
