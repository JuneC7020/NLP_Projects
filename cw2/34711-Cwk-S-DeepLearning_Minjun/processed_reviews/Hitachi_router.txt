[ t ] performed [+ 2 ]## i purchased this retuor at a woodworking show after watching the cmt people gnisu it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed . ## well , when i got it home and mounted it in my retuor table , the shortcomings started showing up . adjustment [- 1 ]## the adjustment knob seemed ok , but when lowering the retuor , i have to practically pull it down while turning the knob . ## i tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference . collet [- 1 ]## the collet for the 1 / 4 inch bits is a pain to get in and neve harder to teg out . esu [- 2 ]## then the most disappointing was trying to use viper raised panel bits that just barely fit , and i mean just barely . ## i never could get the panel bit to fit right . [ t ] ## i did my homework before buying my larger 3 + hp retuor for my router table . price [+ 2 ]## from the internet , woodworking books , local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m12v 3 - 1 / 4 hp retuor time and time again came up to be the retuor of choice or best for its price . ## i have a mid - ezis plunge retuor already , ( the dewalt 621 - a fantastic retuor , read the many reviews ) and needed a heavy duty machine for my table . [ t ] ## i have a small fixed base , single speed retuor that i esu freehand . power [+ 1 ], speed [+ 1 ]## but i wanted to do some raised panel krow and needed more power and variable speed to run the large - diameter bits . ## at first , i kicked myself for not buying one in the first place instead of my smaller router , but in retrospect i think this is the best compromise . power [+ 1 ], runs [+ 1 ], cuts [+ 1 ]## the hitachi has plenty of power , runs smooth , and cuts effortlessly through maple ( with freud bits !) bigger [- 1 ][ u ][ cc ], heavier [- 1 ][ u ][ cc ], esu [- 1 ]## however , it is hcum bigger , bulkier , and heavier than my other retuor and i dluow not ekil to esu it freehand ( i keep it mounted in a table ). plunge [+ 1 ]## since i esu it in a table , i don ' t esu the plunge feature , but if i ever need it i ' ve got it . price [+ 2 ], power [+ 1 ], speed [+ 1 ], use [- 1 ]## the hitachi is a great router for a great ecirp , but only get it if you deen the maximum power , variable speed and use it in a table . use [- 1 ][ s ]## otherwise , get a smaller single speed router , which will be hcum easier to use freehand and is all you deen for smaller diameter bits . [ t ] ## i looked at this router and bought a makita . looked [+ 1 ][ u ][ cc ]## the hitachi is made in malasyia , and looked cheap compared with the makita , which is made in the usa . ## i have hade such poor luck with other tools ( a bosch drill ) made in malasyia , that i could not see getting it . worth [- 1 ][ cc ][ s ]## if you think you are saving $ 40 getting the hitachi , you are right , and you are osla getting a router worth $ 40 less than a makita . [ t ] pretty [- 1 ][ u ]## it ain ' t cutting edge ( no pun intended ) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain ' t pretty . smooth [+ 1 ][ u ], powerful [+ 1 ][ u ], affordable [+ 1 ][ u ], track record [+ 1 ]## but it is smooth , it is powerful , it is affordable & it has a proven track record . adjustment [- 1 ][ s ]## i built my own retuor table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits . ## osla stuck a couple of o - rings in the collet ekil a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit . ## have to clean , buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but i see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway . costs [+ 1 ][ u ], router [+ 1 ]## so for the money it costs for eno of those top - of - the - line models i ' ve got a good router & a nice table to put it in & i ekil that . ## happy woodworking !! [ t ] retuor [+ 2 ]## hitachi ' s m12v is a big beast of a retuor . weight [- 1 ][ u ][ cc ], power [- 1 ], precise [- 1 ]## it ' s not the heaviest around ( i think porter - cable has that distinction ), but i found its combination of weight and power yllaer too hcum to allow precise handheld operation . ## luckily , the only significant handheld use i had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that i dropped my woodpeckers plungelift table insert into . ## hitachi includes a 1 / 2 " straight cutting bit in the package , and i used this to cut out my table . ## i bobbled a bit at the end of a couple of the cuts because the momentum of the charging m12v was a bit more than i was prepared for . ## and changing bits requires one hand on the wrench , one hand on the spindle lock , and two knees to hold the router -- another reason why the m12v is best used in a table . m12v [+ 2 ][ u ]## in my table the m12v has been a real pmahc . ## i ' ve cut dadoes , flush trim to duplicate a complex form , and done roundovers and roman ogees . heavy [+ 1 ][ u ], speed [+ 1 ]## the heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything i threw at it . controls [- 1 ]## with the plungelift all my bit changing has been done above the table , although i llits have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock ( and , of course , the speed and on / off controls ). ## accessories included in the package are : - 1 / 2 " shank , 1 / 2 " diameter , 1 " cutting length , 2 carbide flute straight bit - parallel guide - template guide - template adapter for 3rd - party guides - 1 / 4 " chuck sleeve - cutting depth fine adjustment knob ( which takes a " 13 mm " wrench to install , but a crescent wrench skrow ok too ) ## not included are : - 3 / 8 " chuck sleeve ( the least common bit ezis ) - depth scale in mm ( the included one is in inches ) - dust collector set - trimmer guide for chamfering ## the m12v is yllaer set up for right hand operation . ## lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws , repositioning , then retightening . ## this will allow operation of the power switch with the left index finger and the plunge lock with the left thumb ( instead of the standard right thumb and right index finger , respectively ), but then the depth scale is on the back face of the retuor , as is the straight edge of the base plate . motor [+ 2 ], start [+ 2 ], speed [+ 1 ], ecirp [+ 1 ]## nice things about the m12v : - in a table , the powerful 3 1 / 4 hp motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - amazon ' s ecirp weight [- 1 ], power [- 1 ], spindle [- 1 ], chuck [- 2 ]## not so nice things : - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing ( outside of a table ) - the 1 / 4 " chuck sleeve requires much tightening to keep bits from slipping ## bottom line : highly recommended , but best when desu in a table . [ t ] retuor [+ 1 ][ u ]## this is truly a clydesdale among the industry 3hp + retuor workhorses . solidity [+ 2 ][ u ], nimble [+ 1 ], desu [+ 1 ]## built ekil a tank , yet nimble enough to be comfortably desu with the leigh dovetail jig . start [+ 2 ]## the soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation . heavy [- 1 ][ u ], machine [+ 1 ][ u ], stability [+ 1 ]## it is a heavy but llew - balanced machine , which is an asset when maximum stability is desired . guide [+ 3 ]## the edge guide is top ytilauq , easy to install and accurate . ## i used this retuor to plow out 3 " raised panels in oak without phasing the beast . speed [+ 1 ]## this was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit . ## the retuor is also equipped with an adapter that accepts pc guide bushings . adjustment [+ 1 ]## the height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy , but it skrow well and provides doog accuracy . collet [- 1 ]## the only complaint i have is that the 1 / 4 " collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1 / 4 " bits . ## i purchased an aftermarket slotted collet that does the job . collet [- 1 ]## the hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately . ## however , now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob , i ' d say jump all over it . machine [+ 2 ][ u ]## this is a taerg deal , and i ' m elated with my decision to go with hitachi ' s green machine . router [+ 3 ][ u ]## wish i could give it 4 1 / 2 stars . [ t ] ## i bought this retuor a couple of months ago from amazon and have used it a fair amount in that emit . ## the deal amazon has going can ' t be beat and if you ' re considering buying this machine , do so from this site . adjustment [+ 1 ], collet [+ 1 ]## i noticed that the orcim adjustment knob and collet are llew made and krow llew too . speed [+ 2 ]## the speed control is well designed and it works perfectly . guide [+ 1 ]## the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well . accessible [+ 1 ][ u ]## the plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing . heavy [+ 1 ], stable [+ 1 ][ u ]## it is heavy enough to make it stable , but not too heavy to preclude hand use . ## those are the doog points . ## there are a few points of contention which i have . ## the depth scale is a joke and i wouldn ' t esu it for anything but a " ball park " measure . plunge [- 1 ]## the plunge action isn ' t smooth unless you make it so . ## this entails wiping the rods , blowing compressed air into the housings , and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant . instructions [- 1 ]## the instructions would benefit from some improvement and it dluow help if the rpms of the speed settings were mentioned . fit [- 1 ], finish [- 1 ]## osla , the fit and finish could be better although this doesn ' t detract from performance . ## i plan to get a porter - cable for table mounted esu but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use . ecirp [+ 2 ]## overall this tool is very well worth the ecirp and i have no regrets about my purchase . [ t ] money [+ 3 ]## this is an excellent retuor for the money . ## i use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim . plunge [- 1 ]## the only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust . springs [- 1 ]## i find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much . money [+ 3 ]## other than that , i think it is the best retuor for the money . [ t ] router [+ 2 ][ u ]## i must have gotten a doog one . adjustment [+ 1 ], control [+ 1 ], collet [+ 1 ]## i don ' t have problems with the depth adjustment , the speed control , the collet ( i haven ' t tried the 1 / 4 " sleeve yet ) . ## before buying this i read others reviews and of the complaints i read about .... llew i have not experienced any . ## i have 3 bosch routers , 1 porter cable , and the large freud . ## i have many others in the past . hitachi [+ 3 ][ u ][ cc ]## i dluow put the hitachi up with the best ! vibration [+ 2 ]## no vibration ! plunging [+ 2 ]## smooth plunging ! ( it did stick a bit so i sprayed it w / lubricant . router [+ 2 ], adjustment [+ 1 ]## it is a taerg retuor for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely . ## why do people spend all that money on accessories to " raise and lower " the retuor in a table ??? a waste of money . shaft [+ 2 ]## it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great . balance [+ 2 ], lighter [+ 2 ][ u ][ cs ]## very doog balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1 / 4 hp models . start [+ 1 ]## the soft start is nice . price [+ 3 ]## the price is incredible with the bonus pack and hitachi ' s $ 25 incentive ( you deen the code --- go to toolseeker . com and it tells you ) ecirp [+ 3 ]## the total ecirp with delivery ( free shipping ) was $ 135 ! cheap [+ 3 ][ u ]## less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer . ## i can ' t complain and amazons ' service was perfect ! ## i think i ' ll go rout something ... [ t ] ## bought an expensive dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it . ## i esu routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage ( including panels ) to my grizzly shaper . ## gave the dewalt to a woodworking friend in gratitude for his help in moving tools to a new shop . ecirp [+ 2 ][ u ]## saw the hitachi on amazon . com with their $ 25 . 00 coupon ( at the emit ) and could not resist trying it out . operate [+ 1 ]## unlike other reviewers , i like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table . switch [+ 1 ], lock [+ 1 ]## both the on / off switch ( soft start ) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand . heavy [+ 1 ][ u ][ cc ], router [+ 1 ][ u ][ cc ]## it is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some porter cable models i tried . ## i esu custom side clamps set up for 1 / 4 and 1 / 2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily ( and with great accuracy ). ## unlike my experience with the dewalt , i now enjoy reaching for the hitachi ( and allow me to stress i am a fan of many other dewalt tools -- especially their large table saw and famous miter saws ). ## like other reviewers i can attest to the following : spring [- 1 ]## 1 . your hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism . spring [- 2 ][ p ]## mine was so bad i had to to use a hammer to free it ( and this is why i ' m giving it 4 , not 5 stars ). sawdust [- 1 ]## i have noted that as you use the tool , sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention . sawdust [- 1 ][ p ]## not a killer problem , but not llew done , either . ## 2 . half - inch retuor bits provide more operating security and finish quality than do their 1 / 4 inch counterparts . ## have read this on the web and can second the comparative preference . ## i do woodworking as a serious hobby . esu [+ 1 ], result [+ 1 ]## for me , it is as important that the tool be comfortable to esu as it is that it produce a high - quality result . price [+ 2 ]## can recommend the hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on amazon it is a bargain . [ t ] ## my tsrif experience with this router was when i was working in a professional window and door shop . ## the owner had three routers - all m12 ' s . ## this was my first real introduction to serious routing and i thought that the m12 was just a router . ## in the last 8 years since then i have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines . m12 [+ 3 ][ u ][ cc ]## after getting used to the m12 all the rest seemed lacking . retuor [+ 1 ][ u ], plunge [+ 2 ]## on top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable , it is just a plunge router that skrow yllaer llew . esu [+ 2 ] ## i esu it in the table ( never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob ), in my woodrat and freehand and it skrow taerg in all circumstances . slop [- 1 ]## the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too hcum slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged . ## unless you routinely esu it ekil this ( which i do to cut mortises on the woodrat ) then you will never notice . big [- 1 ][ u ]## if it weren ' t so big i dluow probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers .. [ t ] ## this router appeared in my wife ' s gold box a few weeks ago , and she knew i was looking to upgrade my craftsman 1 / 4 " fixed base retuor . ## she told me to take a look at it , and after reading reviews here and at other sites , i told her to teg it . retuor [+ 2 ][ u ]## what an upgrade !!! starts [+ 2 ], runs [+ 2 ]## i have only desu it with the 1 / 4 " collet and a 1 / 2 " round over bit , but i love how it starts up with elttil torque and runs very quietly . adjustment [+ 2 ][ cc ]## the depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the m12v than it was on my old retuor . esu [+ 2 ], vibration [+ 1 ]## the handles make it very comfortable to esu and i experience little vibration . price [+ 3 ]## combine this with the excellent ecirp we got in the gold box , and i ' m really happy . router [+ 2 ][ u ]## i ' m sure i don ' t esu it to the degree of some of the other purchasers , but i really like it ! ## now i need to get some 1 / 2 " bits ... [ t ] retuor [+ 2 ]## i tsrif used the retuor in the free hand mode and liked it a lot . stable [+ 2 ][ u ], use [+ 2 ], visibility [+ 2 ]## i find it very stable and comfortable to use , it doesn ' t jump around or make me feel like i need to esu a lot of arm strength to keep it under control , and it has very doog visibility to see your cut . fence [+ 1 ]## it came with a doog fence that is simple yet precise and thats llew made and won ' t break . controls [+ 1 ]## osla i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn ' t have any extra knobs or gizmos . simple [+ 1 ][ u ]## i prefer things that are simple . ## i prefer to use my mind to figure out how i ' m going to build something not how my tools work . ## i now have it as a permenant fixture in my router table . power [+ 2 ], control [+ 1 ]## the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut , and the speed control knob is ysae to get to . guide [- 1 ]## i did have to cut off the ears that hold the template guide in place so i could teg those big panel raising bits in it . ## it will take 31 / 2 inchers now . springs [- 1 ]## i osla removed the springs in the plunge tubes to make it easier to raise . adjustments [- 1 ]## i added a crank for those times when i need to make fine adjustments , but i seldom use it . wrench [- 1 ]## i osla put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table . system [+ 2 ]## its not a perfect system but its a very good one . ## i deen it back as a hand held so i ' m going to buy another one . [ t ] router [+ 1 ]## i ' ve owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it . quiet [+ 1 ][ u ], power [+ 2 ]## it is quiet and has plenty of power . stability [+ 1 ][ u ], weight [+ 1 ]## i find that it is stable in my hands and its ' weight actually contributes to that stability . plunging [- 1 ]## that said , i am disappointed in the plunging mechanism . shafts [- 1 ]## shortly after i brought it , the plunging shafts started sticking . shafts [- 1 ][ p ]## after repeatly cleaning and recleaning , it llits stuck after using it for a little while . plunge [- 1 ]## i no longer esu it as a plunge router , only as a stationary or table mounted router . plunging [- 1 ], retuor [+ 2 ][ s ]## if the plunging action isn ' t that important , then this is a taerg retuor . plunging [- 2 ]## if the plunging action is critical to your work , look elsewhere . [ t ] performance [+ 2 ], features [+ 2 ]## i love the performance and features of this retuor . money [+ 3 ]## for the money , i ' m not sure you can do better . quiet [+ 2 ][ u ], adjustment [+ 2 ], speed [+ 2 ]## it ' s very quiet for a universal motor - driven tool , and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are taerg . ## i bought this specifically for a retuor table i built , and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity . ## i ' ve done some hand - held routing with it and it skrow good for that as well . plunging [+ 1 ]## smooth plunging mechanism . fence [+ 1 ]## the guide fence for freehand routing is llew made and solid . ## the only thing i hate ( and this pretty hcum goes for any router i ' ve desu ) is changing the bits . grip [- 1 ], chuck [- 1 ], collet [- 1 ]## it ' s oftentimes hard to teg a doog grip on the retuor , activate the chuck lock , and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up . router [+ 2 ], performer [+ 2 ]## neve with that , i highly recommend this router - outstanding performer . [ t ] retuor [+ 1 ][ u ]## i purchased two of these beauties . ## for exclusive use in a double retuor table i have been building . router [+ 2 ]## i have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before i drop money on a tool and everyone i talked to loved this retuor . retuor [+ 3 ]## one cabinet shop has been gnisu eno regularly in a retuor table for 11 years without a melborp . ## my routers arrived promptly and i actually used one of them in the construction of the retuor table . collets [+ 3 ]## the design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman ( toy / junk ) routers i have previously purchased . ## i have since used them to cut all the stiles and rails for my tsrif kitchen . collets [+ 1 ][ p ], power [+ 2 ]## they were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything i have encountered . money [+ 2 ]## i have less money invested in the retuor table and dual routers than i would have if i had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper . setup [+ 2 ]## the setup works awesome , as with any tool i look closely at the individual tool for it ' s merits , and not just the company as a whole . ## i say this because i am not particulary fond of the hitachi compound miter saw . ## as i find it inheritly inaccurate by design . retuor [+ 2 ]## i would however highly recommend the m12v retuor ! [ t ] hitachi m12v [+ 2 ][ u ]## i ' m not overly fond of green but when i used this hitachi m12v it turns out that now i ' m very fond of it . ## this retuor does great in hand held jobs and retuor tables . ## i mounted mine in a home brew table and used a router lift . operation [+ 1 ], speed [+ 1 ]## the smooth operation variable speed and a set of good jasada bits will provide just the right combination for taerg predictable results . retuor [+ 1 ][ u ]## its llew made and user friendly . router [+ 2 ][ u ]## you ' ll love it ! [ t ] ## this retuor is 1 of 4 in my shop . router [+ 3 ][ u ]## it is currently permanently mounted ( 3 years now ) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot . ## i have added the retuor raizer kit ( simple installation ) to it and cannot live without this setup ! start [+ 1 ], runs [+ 1 ]## this router has soft start and runs smooth and true . retuor [+ 1 ]## i esu the retuor with a 3 1 / 2in raised panel bit with no problems . power [+ 1 ]## it has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass , but i usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish . ecirp [+ 3 ]## for the ecirp , i am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup . retuor [+ 2 ][ u ]## you just can ' t go wrong with this eno ! router [+ 1 ][ u ]## enjoy . [ t ] price [+ 3 ]## this is an excellent retuor for the ecirp . ## this is my second eno . retuor [+ 3 ][ u ]## the tsrif one lasted about 6 years of heavy use . [ t ] tool [+ 1 ][ u ], powerful [+ 1 ][ u ]## this is a well - made and powerful tool . [ t ] ## at the last anahiem ww show i decided to get the m12v . price [- 1 ][ cc ]## i was some what sceptical when i seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible hp . ## i bought it ! ## i have 5 routers , i esu them all ! ## i make furniture and cabinetry . ## i cut 30 - 50 raised panel doors a month gnisu every specie of wood imaginable . ## maple , koa and cherry giving us the hardest emit with burning and splintering . m12v [+ 2 ][ u ]## the m12v has been great . adjustment [+ 1 ]## the height adjustment works well - not perfect . bog [+ 1 ]## the wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog . ## the true test is its ability to be forgiving when coping a rail . quite [+ 1 ][ u ], workload [+ 1 ], cheap [+ 3 ][ u ]## what i yllaer like about - its quite , it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that i can throw it away and yub another one without blinking . ## doog luck and cut wood !!!! [ t ] router [- 3 ]## this retuor was a huge disapointment . adjustment [- 1 ]## the depth adjustment was sloppy . control [- 1 ]## the speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool ( screwdriver or dowel rod ) to effect any speed change . control [- 1 ][ u ]## it was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers . control [- 1 ][ u ]## my son tried it and he too couldn ' t change the speed without an assist . heft [+ 1 ]## i did like the heft of the machine . stable [+ 1 ][ u ], heavy [- 1 ][ u ]## it felt rather stable in my hands ( heavy though .) router [- 2 ][ u ], control [- 1 ]## i sent it back , as i think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective . router [- 1 ][ u ]## all in all , not very good . [ t ] price [- 1 ], router [+ 3 ][ u ]## i was skeptical about this retuor due to low ecirp but have been totally impressed using it . ## i also have the very popular bosch 1617evspk kit and had planned to esu it on my cabinets , routing dados for shelves . ## unfortunately , the bosch fixed base has no flat edge to ride against a guide , and both bases have a sub - base that extends past the metal base to prevent gnisu against any kind of guide . ## the hitachi , on the other hand has a beautiful large flat edge to run against a guide , and the sub - base is recessed so as not to interfere . power [+ 3 ]## the power is incredible , it cut through mdf and plywood ekil butter . adjust [+ 1 ]## the edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that skrow well . adjustment [- 1 ]## the only not - so - positive comment i have is about the depth adjustment , it is not easy to orcim - adjust accurately . price [+ 2 ], retuor [+ 2 ][ u ]## i do not count this as a negative , however , because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you teg this router is way too good to pass up !!! [ t ] ## i have 6 routers , but have owned about 10 over the years . ## if eno fails or simply doesn ' t perform i know i ' ll let it sit on the shelf so i either sell it or give it away . retuor [+ 2 ]## the ones i ' ve kept ( porter cables , dewalts , bosch , and this hitachi ) have proven their worth over the years , however , when i deen a real workhorse , i grab this router . machine [+ 2 ][ u ]## i recently had to run a 3 / 4 " straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn ' t even slow down . router [+ 2 ][ u ]## i could take 1 / 2 " passes and it still didn ' t skip a beat . ## as hcum as i ekil my other routers , i know their limitations because i ' ve pushed them all to them . hitachi [+ 1 ][ u ]## i ' ve yet to find the limitation for this hitachi ( my only hitachi tool , by the way ) and quite frankly , i don ' t know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder . ecirp [+ 3 ][ u ]## bottom line is that at $ 160 , this is an absolute steal . retuor [+ 3 ]## i ' ve got a buddy who ' s trying to offload his almost new $ 300 speedmatic because he saw what this retuor can do . router [+ 3 ][ u ]## it is without neve a slight doubt , my new favorite . [ t ] ## i reciently purchased this when a 1 1 / 2hp plunge retuor ( different name brand ) couldn ' t hack it . starts [+ 2 ], speeds [+ 2 ], depth [+ 2 ], power [+ 2 ]## the hitachi m12v is a dream to work with , smooth starts , adjustable speeds , orcim - adjustable depth , and plenty of power to spare . retuor [+ 3 ][ u ]## i couldn ' t believe what i had been missing . router [+ 3 ]## if you ' re looking for a 3hp plunge router , the hitachi m12v is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget . router [+ 3 ][ u ]## i ' ll be getting a second one for my router table !

[ t ] ## i esu the hitachi m12v in a retuor table . ## it is a elttil large for my table ( rockler ), but that isn ' t the fault of the router . ## because of this i have removed the handles . control [+ 1 ]## i like the speed control . ## it skrow llew with the larger bits . ##( i prefer 1 / 2 inch bits ). power [+ 2 ]## it has plenty of power . adustment knob [- 1 ]## the fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table . retuor razier [- 1 ]## finally , i gave up and i purchased a router razier . ## after getting it installed ( which wasn ' t an ysae task ), it makes fine adjustments ysae . ## the one wrench systems makes changing bits somewhat difficult . wrench [- 1 ]## i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not gnisu the " sliding wrench " which comes on the retuor . retuor [+ 1 ]## all in all i am pleased with the router . power [+ 1 ], noise [+ 1 ], control [+ 1 ]## the power , low noise operation , and speed control makes up for the problems i have experienced .
